41294-10ladisl.jpg	Of the Hungarian kings St Ladislas is perhaps the one most often represented in post-medieval frescoes, altar paintings and statues. In the Middle Ages he was associated with the ideal of chivalry and the legends which gathered around him determined the manner of his representation. Thus the knightly armour and the battle-axe have become permanent attributes, in addition to the crown and the orb.The painting illustrated here, dating from the late sixteenth century, is only superficially linked with medieval portraits of St. Ladislas. The king is shown seated on a throne wearing an ample, richly embroidered cloak studded with pearls round the hem. In the foreground is a voluted and foiled shield with the national emblem, stylized in harmony with the throne. The background is designed to suggest the interior of a Renaissance palace. Through opening on either side of the wall behind the throne - draped with embroidered hangings - there is a view of landscape. A similar motif was often used to fill in the background in north Italian Madonna paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The monochrome landscape on the left is a topographic reference to one of St. Ladislas' most important church activities, the foundation of the Cathedral in Nagyvárad, while the one on the right shows his legendary defeat of the Cumanian abductor. This evocation of two popular episodes from the story of the king's life is intended partly to identify St. Ladislas as a rule of worldly power, and partly to indicate the ideal unity of the Christian king and the Christian knight.St Ladislas is shown as a historical personage, without a halo - a fact indicating that the painting was destined for a secular building. The episodes from the king's life or, to be mere accurate, from legends associated with his name, are treated as historical facts. The same approach characterized the series of prints of royalty and other notabilities which became so popular all Europe in the course of the sixteenth century. It may be assumed that such prints served as models for the painted portrait of St. Ladislas and the two related pictures of St. Stephen and St Emeric	UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian	Saint Ladislaus, King of Hungary	Oil on wood, 103 x 101,3 cm	c. 1600	religious	Hungarian	1551-1600
42791-1sacris.jpg	This ceiling painting in the sacristy of San Sebastiano has an unusual iconography compared with older depictions. Mary is being crowned by Christ, while God the Father touches His Son's shoulder with his left hand. The date of completion of the ceiling painting is recorded in a book in one of the four corner tondos held by a winged angel. The inscription reads: M.D.L.V./ DIE XXIII/ NOVEMBER (November 23, 1555)	VERONESE, Paolo	Coronation of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 200 x 170 cm	1555	religious	Italian	1551-1600
14376-worship.jpg	In the same period when the most talented artists in the country had gathered around Rubens in Antwerp, there were also other artists working in Antwerp who still clung to the taste of Rubens' predecessors. One of these was Frans II Francken, who painted Rockox's 'constcamer'. He was a very popular artist in his time, and although he lacked any outstanding imaginative power or great technical skill, his fame rests on his ability to convert monumental subjects from large-scale art works to proportions more suitable for private houses. The Worship of the Golden Calf is a typical example of the many religious and mythological scenes he painted	FRANCKEN, Frans II	Worship of the Golden Calf	Oil on panel, 60 x 88 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
24776-annuncia.jpg	"Based on its style the Annunciation is attributed to the Master of Flémalle and dated between c. 1415 and 1425. The painter's provisional name refers to the ""Abbey of Flémalle"" where certain of his works are assumed to have been painted. However, in this village near Liège there was never any abbey. Today the master is commonly identified with the Tournai artist Robert Campin.The scene takes place inside a bourgeois dwelling, a novelty in the painting of the time, as until then the scene had always been depicted in or in front of a church. In line with tradition, Gabriel enters the room from the left. The Virgin is seated in front of a low bench on the tiled floor, a sign of her humility. The edge of her mantle is decorated with an inscription, another innovation of the Master of Flémalle. Its text appears to be inspired by the popular medieval Marian hymn Salve Regina. The Virgin's gestures illustrate her acceptance. Her right hand rests on her breast, her eyes modestly cast downwards. On Mary's lap is an open book, a second one lies on the table. This motif is possibly taken from devotional tracts of around 1400, which state that the Virgin was meditating on the Holy Scriptures when Gabriel entered. The books also indicate her as the possessor of divine wisdom. In this connection, the bench is decorated with little lions, as was once the throne of Solomon, the Old Testament king who used to be seen as the epitome of wisdom. The stained glass figures possibly represent prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.Other apparently everyday objects also have an additional, deeper significance. The hand broom next to the chimney symbolises the purification from the stain of sin, and the white lilies in the maiolica vase Mary's virginity. The open window probably alludes to her honorary title as 'fenestra coeli', the window of heaven. The candles and their holders refer to Christ and the Virgin. The fact that the candles are snuffed out indicates that conception has already taken place. One intriguing detail is the woodcut above the chimney, depicting St Christopher carrying the Child across the river. This motif is a good illustration of the chronological jumps frequently found in the paintings of Flemish Primitives, as according to the main scene, depicting the Annunciation, the Saviour has not even been born"	MASTER of Flémalle	Annunciation	Tempera on oak, 61 x 63,7 cm	1420s	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

07338-st-john.jpg	This painting, contracted on 23 November 1635, was executed for the convent church of Santa Paula in Seville. It is evident that the artist had mastered an Italianate manner of painting; the figure of the angel alone is sufficient to corroborate this observation. The partly clad body, the complicated, foreshortened pose, and the mastery of anatomical drawing are unique elements in Sevillian painting of the time, as are the deep perspective of the landscape and the delicate, translucent colours.Cano's mastery of this facile, sophisticated style suggests that he had passed time in Italy, although there is not the slightest evidence that he left the city until his final departure in 1638	CANO, Alonso	Saint John the Evangelist's Vision of Jerusalem	Oil on canvas, 83 x 44 cm	1636-37	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

24464-pisa_pr1.jpg	This painting is the central predella panel of the Pisa Altarpiece, directly beneath the enthroned Madonna and Child. Compared to Gentile da Fabriano's painting of the same subject done in Florence just a few years before, Masaccio's treatment is entirely new. Besides offering lifelike portraits of the patron and his nephew in contemporary dress at the middle right, he has given the entire scene a convincing atmosphere which surrounds the figures and the landscape. In the distance, the atmosphere breaks down the clarity of the forms resulting in an effect which is referred to as aerial perspective	MASACCIO	Adoration of the Magi	Tempera on poplar, 21 x 61 cm	1426	religious	Italian	1401-1450

31921-stillif1.jpg	The large dark vine leaves and fruit are back-lit and are sharply silhouetted against the luminous background, to quite dramatic effect.

16988-nuenen03.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 30, JH 479.In Nuenen between January and August 1884, van Gogh depicted the figure of the weaver working at the loom in several pen drawings, watercolours and oil paintings. In this small village of Northern-Brabant, to where his parents moved in September 1882, more than four hundred people took up weaving, an activity of domestic industry during the winter months, when agricultural labour was suspended.The chronology of the series could be determined by the development in representing the loom. As time went by, van Gogh depicted the loom with more and more precision, abandoning the anecdotal elements and concentrating on the work process and on the machine itself	GOGH, Vincent van	Weaver, Seen from the Front	Oil on canvas, 70 x 85 cm	May 1884, Nuenen	other	Dutch	1851-1900

23235-predell1.jpg	Lorenzo Veneziano fulfilled countless commissions in Venice and its vicinity that display a handsome fusion of Byzantine and later pictorial currents. His commissions included that for an altarpiece which was later dismembered. The central panel depicting Christ Giving the Keys to St Peter is now in the Museo Correr, Venice, the side panels were destroyed in Berlin in 1945. The five predella panels survived, they comprise the Conversion of Paul; the Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew; the Christ Rescuing Peter from Drowning; the Apostle Peter Preaching; the Crucifixion of Peter	LORENZO VENEZIANO	Conversion of Paul	Poplar panel, 26 x 33 cm	c. 1370	religious	Italian	1351-1400
10416-19melanc.jpg	Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560) was a German reformer, collaborator with Martin Luther, the first systematic theologian of the Protestant Reformation, intellectual leader of the Lutheran Reformation, and an influential designer of educational systems. He stands next to Luther and Calvin as a reformer, theologian, and molder of Protestantism.Melanchthon had his portrait painted on numerous occasions, but he only sat to four artists: Albrecht Dürer (in an engraving of 1526); Hans Holbein the Younger (whose portrait of circa 1535 is in the Nieders&#228;chsisches Landesmuseums, Hannover); and both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son Lucas Cranach the Younger.Cranach the Younger painted several portraits of Melanchthon, probably from the mid 1540s onwards. The earliest would seem to be that dated 1544, in Östra Ryd, Sweden, and the last painted from life is that signed and dated 1559 in the St&#228;del Museum, Frankfurt am Main, finished just one year before Melanchthon's death at the age of 63. Such was the demand for portraits of Luther and Melanchthon that several posthumous works were produced by Cranach the Younger and his studio	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Portrait of Philipp Melanchthon	Oil on pine panel, 63 x 49 cm	c. 1550	portrait	German	1501-1550

18525-2summer1.jpg	Abel Grimmer continued the themes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and evoked the four seasons in many of his paintings. He copied the subjects produced by Bruegel while adding his own mark: a stylisation of the forms and the introduction of powerful colours.The present panel of Summer is an interpretation of the famous drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This drawing inspired numerous artists including his son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger. Not all refer to the drawing itself, but rather to the engraving of it made by Pieter Cock around 1570. Engraving flourished in Antwerp in the 16th century and was an excellent means of distribution. Hence, artists were familiar with the works of their contemporaries.There are other versions of this painting by Abel Grimmer	GRIMMER, Abel	Summer	Oil on panel, 24 x 37 cm	-	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
34296-sabine2.jpg	The Rape of the Sabine Women and its companion-piece the Battle of the Romans and the Sabines illustrates the legend of Rome's foundation.Romulus, the founder of Rome, succeeded by a ruse in ensuring the future growth of the population. He arranged a festival to which were invited the inhabitants of neighbouring settlements including the Sabines, with their wives and children. During the festivities, at a given signal, the young men of Rome broke into the crowd and, choosing only unmarried maidens of the Sabines, carried them off. The Sabine women accepted their lot. But later a Sabine army attacked the city in force and succeeded in overcoming part of it. They were prevented from going further by the intervention of the Sabine women which brought about peace between the warring soldiers.The glowing colours of the two paintings reveal the influence of Paolo Veronese, while the pastel illumination of Ricci's palette anticipates the Rococo	RICCI, Sebastiano	Battle of the Romans and the Sabines	Oil on canvas, 197 x 303 cm	c. 1700	historical	Italian	1701-1750
18753-guard219.jpg	"Francesco Guardi was a collaborator of Gianantonio, from whom he learned the craft of painting, but he introduced into his older brothers art his own profoundly meditative personality. This fact is evinced by the essential differences to be discerned in the works the ""workshop"" produced. This picture, unanimously attributed by researchers to Francesco, is, in all likelihood, the fragment of a larger composition. The whole scene is summarized in the slow and calm movement of the gondoliere in the foreground, whereas the scenery of the lagoon virtually disintegrates in the mother-of-pearl atmosphere, which is lightened here and there by some rare flashes in the background. The lonely gondola is seen in the lagoon at the Fondamente Nuove, in front of the islands of San Cristoforo and San Michele.The emotional intensity of the painting is condensed into this brief recording of the moment, as if it were a ""phrase in music"", for example in Vivaldi's or Albinoni's compositions of the same theme. The smooth lagoon and the ""adagio continuo"" are parallel motifs of picture and music. The scenery becomes dissolved in musicality, as musicality disintegrates ""in sorrowful weeping"" (Goethe).The mournful character of the black gondola is both a forecast and a conscious experience of the future destiny of the world of lagoons &#151; a world enclosed within its own modest boundaries. This is a world which has disappeared, because it was linked to a declining civilization. The argument was not continued, and it has not been taken up again; the other lagoon painters, such as the members of the Burano school, could not disguise the emptiness &#151; not only of form but also of content."

28665-1london3.jpg	"This canvas belongs to a series of eleven paintings executed after Monet's stays in London. The Parliament building is viewed from a window of St. Thomas's Hospital located on the opposite shore of the Thames.During his four visits to London between 1900 and 1905, Monet did a series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament. In these works his art attained new heights. Everything visible is resolved in the reflection of light. The subtitle of the painting, ""With the Sun Shining through Fog"", is significant. Not only the sky, but also the river and even the buildings are fused together in dazzling colour tones. The Houses of Parliament rise up out of the fog like a vision. It is not the building which seems to be present but rather its optical effect"	MONET, Claude	The Houses of Parliament in London	Oil on canvas, 81 x 92 cm	1904	landscape	French	1851-1900
25321-triptyc1.jpg	This painting is the central panel of a triptych. The wings represents Sts John the Baptist and Anthony of Padua with the donor Bonifazio Lupi (left), and Sts John the Evangelist and Louis of Toulouse with Catarina dei Francesi, the donor's wife.While continuing to refer to Giotto, Florentine painters began to introduce a refined linear Gothic style. An example is the triptych by Tommaso del Mazza, commisssioned for the main altar of the hospital founded in Florence by Bonifazio Lupi in 1386, and dedicated to Saint John the Baptist	MAZZA, Tommaso del	Virgin and Child with Eight Angels	Poplar panel, gold ground, 85 x 61 cm	c. 1385	religious	Italian	1351-1400
23919-denial.jpg	Manfredi created a series of theatrically lit compositions in which bawdy figures crowd around a table gambling, drinking and making music. In his Denial of St Peter the tavern scene is transformed into a religious narrative in which the soldiers' game of dice is given more prominence than Peter's betrayal.

21214-richter2.jpg	The mood of the time is very evident in the matching pair of portrait's of Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal, who was a Viennese official who had been ennobled, and his wife, Maria Angelica Richter von Binnenthal, née Freiin von Zach. The graceful wife bears the 25-year difference in age from her husband with the same dignity as he wears his 1814 medal. Moreover, the colours of the clothing are skillfully balanced: her black dress with its white collar is the inversion of his Habsburg uniform. Her white lace collar also indicates a fashion during the Restoration, when the house of Habsburg liked to look back to its old Spanish empire	KRAFFT, Johann Peter	Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal	Oil on canvas, 53 x 43 cn	1814-15	portrait	Austrian	1801-1850

21435-fetewood.jpg	The composition reflects Lancret's dependence on Watteau, under whom he had briefly studied c. 1717.

20040-032mocki.jpg	This painting is closely related to another work by Honthors, a vertical version of the same theme in a private collection. Since some of the same expressive devices are found in both pictures - for example , the way in which the extended hand of the standing mocker holding a candle casts its shadow on his face - both were likely to have been executed relatively close in time.The size of the canvas suggests that it was a public commisssion, perhaps for a church in or near Rome	HONTHORST, Gerrit van	The Mocking of Christ	Oil on canvas, 146 x 207 cm cm	c. 1617	religious	Dutch	1601-1650
41521-z_battle.jpg	This large tapestry cartoon represents a subject drawn from Livy and Polybius. It was preparatory for the weaving of a section of the Tapestry of Scipio executed in Brussels c. 1558 for Jacques d'Albon, Maréchal de Saint-André and favourite of King Henri II  of France. The artist, who was certainly Mantuan and shows himself here to be a follower of Giulio Romano, was perhaps Fermo Ghisoni (c. 1505-1575)	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	The Battle of the Ticino	Distemper on sheets of paper mounted on canvas, 385 x 655 cm	1550s	historical	Italian	1551-1600
39675-13tribut.jpg	The subject of this painting is taken from the New Testament. The Pharisees ask Christ whether it is right to pay tax to the Romans. Christ, sensing the trap, asks whose likeness and name are on the coinage: 'They say unto him, Caesar's. Then he saith unto them, render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's' (Matthew 22; Mark 12, Luke 20).This painting was probably painted for King Philip II and sent to Spain in 1568	TIZIANO Vecellio	Tribute Money	Oil on canvas, 112 x 103 cm	1560-68	religious	Italian	1501-1550

Like his father he sought a military career; he entered the army in 1726 and was a captain in the 3rd foot guards by the end of 1734. Undoubted bravery, far-flung service, generosity of spirit, and courageous persistence in living with a painful wound made ""the gallant earl"" a hero to his contemporaries"	WAITT, Richard	Portrait of John 20th Earl of Crawford and Lindsay	Oil on canvas laid onto board	1725-30	portrait	Scottish	1701-1750

19406-stillif1.jpg	Heda did not start to paint diagonal compositions until the mid-1630s: the compositions start with flat plates, continue with pieces of ham and goblets, and culminate in a zenith-like fashion with beer or water jug. At times this pattern was of course broken, especially when Heda had to depict the valuable crockery of distinguished households, such as columbine goblets, cups of welcome, etc. Heda then went back either to his triangular or his pyramid-shaped compositions. But it is noticeable that whenever he did this, he also increased the incidence of 'chaotic' elements, showing, for example, the white table-cloth extremely crumpled as well as an overturned jug. (The overturning of goblets goes back to an ancient custom, and in the 16th and 17th centuries goldsmiths, for example, fashioned special goblets that had to be emptied all at once so that they could be placed on the table upside down.

16070-joachi1.jpg	The elderly Joachim is denied entry to the temple, as he has remained childless. The architecture reinforces the priest's gesture of rejection, to which the saint replies with a saddened look. The sheep, as a sacrificial animal that has become superfluous, has a particularly touching effect.The rejection of Joachim's sacrifice and his expulsion from the Temple occurred because of his childlessness. Here we are dealing with a true opening picture: the closed architecture of the temple introduces the first idea of solidity, while Joachim's dual movement brings this scene to a close, on the one hand, and on the other paves the way for the rest of the series, which finds a premature conclusion in the last picture of this register, the Meeting at the Golden Gate.The action is also driven forward by the repetition of buildings. Thus the temple of the opening picture reappears in the fresco Presentation of Christ at the Temple	GIOTTO di Bondone	No. 1 Scenes from the Life of Joachim: 1.

39719-2venus_a.jpg	"Between 1553 and 1554 Titian executed for the Habsburgs two classical mythological works of clearly erotic intent which he himself described as ""poesie"" (mythological fables). These are the Dana&#235; with a Nurse and the Venus and Adonis, both now in the Prado, Madrid. The Venus and Adonis became the prototype for a whole series of replicas of this subject.Venus, the goddess of love, falls in love with Adonis, a beautiful youth. Her love is not, however, enough to stop him pursuing his favourite pastime, hunting, which will lead to his undoing, for he is gored to death by a boar. There is an interesting letter from Titian to Philip II which deals with this painting. The artist makes a special point of mentioning that he was particularly interested in depicting the body from both sides.In both paintings the scene of the union of the lovers is bathed in the warm light of sunset, where the diffuse softness of the colours holds sway. The female nudes reveal the continuing inspiration of Michelangelo's sculpture, such as the Dawn and Night from the Medici tombs in Florence. But what is entirely personal to Titian is the quality of the colour, which fragments into patches of dazzling luminosity - a perfect complement to the ecstatic sensuous abandon of the figures.In its own day Venus and Adonis was considered one of Titian's most erotic works, especially in the compression of Venus' buttocks in her seated pose, but it also suggests the indulgent condescension of a younger man towards the frantic and overprotective reaction of an older woman"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 180 x 207 cm	1554	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

26746-06_1sp5f.jpg	The figures are in the triangular spandrel in the sixth bay between Ezekiel and the Persian Sibyl. The spandrel is situated over the Rehoboam-Abijah lunette.Michelangelo painted a family group in this lunette. The woman, seen in profile, is seated in the foreground, in an absorbed attitude, her chin resting on her hand; with her other arm she embraces her child. Behind her, the gray-haired head of a male figure emerges from the shadows.Above, on each side of the ram's skull, the bronze nudes no longer take the form of motionless, reclining figures, but are howling demons who struggle furiously in almost acrobatic positions in the restricted space enclosing them. Although their poses are perfectly symmetrical, their hair seems to be blown in the same direction, as if by a sudden gust of wind.It is usually assumed that the male figure in the shadows represents Solomon, the father of Rehoboam	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Ancestors of Christ: figures	Fresco, 245 x 340 cm	1511	religious	Italian	1501-1550
24599-st_john3.jpg	The left wing shows Salome offering the head of St John the Baptist to Herod. In this panel every face bears the stamp of evil. Herodias uses the tip of her knife to make her mark in the saint's forehead; she is presented as the perfect courtesan untrustworthy and vindictive. Herod himself, with his thick lips, hooked nose and narrowed eyes, even seems a little frightened by what he has just done. The whole panel is marked by an extraordinary sense of profane pleasure in such a sumptuous display of rich colours	MASSYS, Quentin	St John Altarpiece (left wing)	Oil on wood	1507-08	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
18912-11aurora.jpg	The ceiling painting in the Sala della Fama, the central hall on the second floor, is entirely allegorical. The central picture is designed as a fictive opening with only a few figures. In the centre hovers the personification of Fame in billowing robes, holding in her outstretched hands an extremely long trumpet and an olive branch as a symbol of peace. Flying in front of her is the brightly feathered phoenix of myth, which is reborn out of its own ashes every five hundred years and was therefore considered a symbol of eternal renewal, but was understood also as a link to virtue. In the lower part of the picture space personifications of Honour (Honos) and Virtue (Virtus) are seated on a dark gray cloud.

00819-marco_p9.jpg	This picture was placed on the right lateral side of the predella. Justinian sleeps while Sts Cosmas and Damian enter his chamber trailing patches of soft cloud. They replace his corrupted leg with a healthy one. The room is Spartan but the variety of light-sources and Angelico's close observation give it interest. Light floods in from outside through the window on the left, illuminating its own frame and parts of the swags of curtain. Exterior space is indicated not only by the window but by the door opposite it, from whence comes more light. From the front left outside the picture comes the third source of light, which produces a broad diagonal sweep across the right wall. The curtain provides the rectangular backdrop parallel to the picture surface which is common to each of these predella panels, and also hints at more, obscured space behind it. The container hanging from a nail on the side of the bed, the glass and decanter, the slippers and the simple three-legged stool, all provide the constituents of a closely observed still-life	ANGELICO, Fra	The Healing of Justinian by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian	Tempera on wood, 37 x 45 cm	1438-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450
34462-18rippl.jpg	The picture represents a major milestone in Rippl's oevre where two periods meet: elements of  intimate interior pictures  and those of the next decorative period with  corn are present. There is a constant figure of interior pictures: a old man smoking the pipe while he is meditating. He is present in this picture, too, he is sitting by the artist's father lost in thoughts. Unlike his previous pictures showing interiors, he limits space and does not show details, only relevant things. It integrates less formal pictures arresting emotions and atmospheres with pictures of strict composition.In the case of this picture everything is planned, colours and figures serve the unity of the composition. Spots and patches painted with wide brushstrokes can be seen in the figure of Uncle Piacsek and the lively yellow of the plain background. Neither the new technique, nor  the noisy colours  (yellow wall, burning-red table-cloth)  serve unrestrained decorativity, they balance the strict composition.  This is why an armchair  with blue striped cover  and a green cover are placed  on both sides by the yellow background. The wine-jug and the two glasses have the same function in composition	RIPPL-RÓNAI, József	Father and Uncle Piacsek Drinking Red Wine	Oil on cardboard, 68 x 100 cm	1907	portrait	Hungarian	1851-1900
30682-basket.jpg	This painting of a basket of flowers and its pair (Madrid, Museo del Prado) follow closely a type of flower piece made popular by Juan de Arellano in which the flowers occupy an open weave wicker basket placed on a rough stone ledge. Such images of flowers casually arranged and filling an open weave basket differ from the formal presentations of bouquets in vases and were perhaps intended to be seen as recently-gathered fresh flowers on short stems. Although the paintings have been considered early works by Pérez for reasons of their closeness to the typology of Arellano s works, they show that the painter was evidently in full possession of the technical resources that distinguish his mature style.In the 17th century, flower paintings commonly made up the decoration of chapels and monastic institutions. While it does not appear that symbolism played a significant role in Spanish flower paintings, viewers of a more sombre cast of mind could have read a Vanitas message in such pictures, in which the brief life of the flowers was a metaphor for human existence.

41468-madfinch.jpg	According to legend, the goldfinch acquired the red spot on its brow when it removed a thorn from Christ's head during his ascent to Calvary, and was splashed with a drop of blood. Its inclusion in images of the Madonna and Child is, therefore, a symbol of Christ's future Passion.This well-preserved panel was formerly attributed to Antonio Vivarini, then to Girolamo di Giovanni da Camerino. However, it appears to be by an anonymous Tuscan artist close to Domenico Veneziano and Giovanni di Francesco	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Madonna and Child with a Goldfinch	Tempera on panel, 77 x 51 cm	around 1450	religious	Italian	1401-1450

11177-1870s_77.jpg	Louis Edmond Duranty (1833-1880) was a prolific French novelist and art critic. He supported the realist cause and later the Impressionists. He was a frequent visitor to the Café Guerbois group, which included Manet, at the centre of the group, and many writers and painters. Their vigorous debates provided Degas with an entirely new mental environment.Degas was particularly close to Duranty, and painted a celebrated portrait of him in 1879.

On the right of the picture, the royal household and dignitaries of empire are gathered, while the father of the bride, Count Raynald of Burgundy, kneels on the steps to the left of the altar, accompanied by two pageboys. The court jester, seen from behind, occupies a prominent position in the foreground at the foot of the steps to the altar, an example of Tiepolo's penchant for introducing witty and frivolous ideas to the agreed pictorial subject matter. The steps to the altar lead us into the picture and, along with the colossal background architecture, create great spatial depth. The musicians on the balcony in the background are a favourite motif of Tiepolo, which he uses to help make the historical subject matter topical	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Marriage of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Beatrice of Burgundy	Fresco, 400 x 500 cm	1751	historical	Italian	1701-1750

The fresco decoration of the nave of the Romanesque-Gothic church began in the 1340s and continued through three phases in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The decoration encompassed New Testament scenes in the north aisle by Lippo Memmi (c. 1340), Old Testament scenes in the south aisle by Bartolo di Fredi (1367), and a depiction of the Last Judgment on the east wall and in the first bay of the nave. by Taddeo di Bartolo (c. 1413).The picture shows four scenes from the Old Testament, located in the fourth bay of the south aisle.

00475-venus2.jpg	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn. These subjects represent two of the most recognizable and classic of all mythological stories, both with a rich history of pictorial representation in Venetian art. They are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and in the case of Venus and Adonis, Amigoni returned to the subject throughout his career	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Bacchus and Ariadne	Oil on canvas, 104 x 129 cm	1730s	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

05715-03beach.jpg	"The skill at seizing the ephemeral and noting essentials characterize the views of Trouville painted by Boudin. Trouville was a fashionable resort under the Second Empire.Boudin, the son of a Honfleur sailor, spent most of his life in seaside towns and concentrated on painting landscapes by the sea, everyday coastal scenes. The tradition he was following was primarily an English one, though Boudin did not paint ships at sea. The pictures he painted over the years in his loose, sketchy way did not, strictly speaking, possess any central subjects. Even his market or beach scenes present an extensive panorama of colour and economically deployed line accentuation. The atmosphere is bright, moist and highly sensitively registered.

When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ismael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved.

34475-1virgin.jpg	At the end of the 1640s Rizi worked at the court in Madrid, although without an official appointment. Part of his time was dedicated to painting for the Buen Retiro theater, where his undeniable talent for scenographic painting developed. This is displayed in his Virgin and Child with Sts Philip and Francis which might be called the first High Baroque altarpiece painting in Spain. The composition is enclosed within an illusionistic proscenium arch, behind which is seen a landscape vista drawn in the deep perspective of contemporary stage sets. The Virgin and Child are surrounded by a small army of fluttering putti, whose varied poses imitate the heavenly glories of Rubens. While the main figures are still firmly and solidly drawn, they have taken on a new sense of animation and movement	RIZI, Francisco	Virgin and Child with Sts Philip and Francis	Oil on canvas	1650	religious	Spanish	1651-1700

20185-commemor.jpg	Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory. In Renaissance painting she is depicted holding a cup or goblet.This painting appears to be influenced by the paintings of the Leidein fijnschilders	HOUBRAKEN, Arnold	Commemoration of King Mausolus by Queen Artemisia	Oil on canvas, 66 x 79 cm	-	historical	Dutch	1651-1700

12490-05self26.jpg	This self portrait is dated 1498 and inscribed: `I have thus painted myself. I was 26 years old. Albrecht Dürer.' Since the artist turned 27 on the 21 May, the picture must date from the beginning of the year. The artist's pose is self confident, showing him standing upright and turning slightly to lean his right arm on a ledge. Dürer's figure fills the picture, with his hat almost touching the top. His face and neck glow from the light streaming into the room and his long curly hair is painstakingly depicted. Unlike his earlier self portrait, he now has a proper beard, which was then unusual among young men. Nine years later Dürer wrote an ironic poem in which he described himself as `the painter with the hairy beard'.The artist's clothing is flamboyant. His elegant jacket is edged with black and beneath this he wears a white, pleated shirt, embroidered along the neckline. His jaunty hat is striped, to match the jacket. Over his left shoulder hangs a light-brown cloak, tied around his neck with a twisted cord. He wears fine kid gloves.Inside the room is a tall archway, partly framing Dürer's head, and to the right a window opens out onto an exquisite landscape. Green fields give way to a tree-ringed lake and beyond are snow-capped mountains, probably a reminder of Dürer's journey over the Alps three years earlier. Depicting a distant landscape, viewed through a window, was a device borrowed from Netherlandish portraiture.The Germans still tended to consider the artist as a craftsman, as had been the conventional view during the Middle Ages. This was bitterly unacceptable to Dürer, whose second Self-Portrait (out of three) shows him as slender and aristocratic, a haughty and foppish youth, ringletted and impassive. His stylish and expensive costume indicates, like the dramatic mountain view through the window (implying wider horizons), that he considers himself no mere limited provincial. What Dürer insists on above all else is his dignity, and this was a quality that he allowed to others too.This picture was acquired by Charles I of England and later bought by Philip IV of Spain	DÜRER, Albrecht	Self-Portrait at 26	Oil on panel, 52 x 41 cm	1498	portrait	German	1501-1550

02996-nativity.jpg	Baldovinetti's Annunciation is in the atrium of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. His interest in local landscape is evident in the Arno Valley view that he chose as the background of this fresco. In fact he painted only a few portions of the picture in true fresco, and then waited until the plaster had dried so that he could paint 'a secco.' But because the fresco was located in an atrium exposed to winter fogs and even rain, in time the a secco faces, hands, and drapery peeled off, and his underdrawing is now visible. Even so, the painting is impressive in the airy openness of its setting and the view over the expansive Tuscan plain, which is filled with the light of a clear winter day	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Nativity	Fresco, 400 x 430 cm	1460-62	religious	Italian	1451-1500
31304-childhoo.jpg	This scene, which probably formed part of a group of panels devoted to the life of Christ, brings together in one spatial setting various episodes from Christ's childhood, giving the painting great narrative interest. Along with the Nativity (treated in the traditional manner of the period, with the Virgin lying down and Joseph on a lower level), the artist has also included the shepherds in the background, two women washing the new-born Christ, and the Adoration of the Magi.

42013-attribut.jpg	The old rivalry between painting and sculpture, the sister arts devoted to the imitation of nature, resurfaces in this painting. The painters had shown that, in their two-dimensional pictures, they were quite capable of offering several views of a body that was equally beautiful from all sides. What theoreticians had presented as an advantage of sculpture became a particular challenge to painting. A plaster Academy model of the antique Belvedere Torso (1st century AD, Rome, Vatican) is here rendered in paint. Like painting and sculpture, architecture was also considered an art of draughtsmanship. Inspired by Chardin, this academic still-life is devoid of all reference to the theme of vanitas that was generally present in compositions on a comparable theme by the older Dutch masters: the focus now falls upon the enlightened erudition of art	VALLAYER-COSTER, Anne	Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture	Oil on canvas, 90 x 121 cm	1769	still-life	French	1751-1800
38597-guardrox.jpg	In a large, open, barn-like structure, which serves as a guardroom, groups of monkeys wearing soldiers' uniforms are grouped around tables playing cards and back-gammon.Pictures of monkeys had been popular from the sixteenth-century and it was Teniers who developed the theme in the seventeenth-century. The primary role of the monkey in visual and literary sources of the sixteenth-century was to represent the irrational and foolish side of man's nature, but monkeys also were symbols of sinfulness and seen as devils	TENIERS, David the Younger	Guardroom with Monkeys	Oil on panel, 41 x 58 cm	1633	genre	Flemish	1651-1700
30593-brazen.jpg	This painting is an impressive example of the artist's heroic and still youthful mode.

37294-40madonn.jpg	"A great deal has been written about the iconography of the Madonna from Lucignano d'Arbia, very unusual in Sienese painting. Mary is shown looking to the right, instead of to the left, and she holds a Child who is not yet a ""puer"" (as was the case in all the earlier paintings) but still an ""infans"" in swaddling clothes. The reason that led Simone to choose this iconography has yet to be explained, and it may have been a specific request from the client; but scholars do agree on the attribution of the panel to Simone"	SIMONE MARTINI	Madonna and Child (from Lucignano d'Arbia)	Tempera on wood, 88 x 51 cm	1321	religious	Italian	1301-1350

28672-3bridge1.jpg	In 1893, Monet purchased land with a pond near his property in Giverny, and he built here his water lily garden with a Japanese bridge spanning the pond at its narrowest point. In 1899, he began a series of eighteen views of the wooden footbridge over the pond, completing twelve paintings, including the present one, that summer. The vertical format of the picture, unusual in this series, gives prominence to the water lilies and their reflections on the pond	MONET, Claude	Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies	Oil on canvas, 93 x 74 cm	1899	landscape	French	1851-1900

18403-1903grec.jpg	El Greco painted several views of Toledo. Seen beneath mountainous clouds the city stirred his imagination and in this painting, as in others, the representation includes an element of fantasy and is not strictly accurate. In the El Greco Museum there is a painting in which a young man is seen holding up a map of the city. The map partially corrects the view of the city in which, to improve the composition as the inscription tells us, El Greco gave the Hospital of Don Juan Tavera a central place in the picture; transferring it from its actual setting so that the façade could be shown without blocking out the other important buildings. In the upper part of the picture there is a scene in which the Virgin presents a vestment to St Ildefonso. The landscape is painted in brownish-green and blue tints, and the mythological and religious elements are minimal; with his pictures of Toledo El Greco created the Spanish landscape, a branch of art which was nevertheless neglected until the emergence of Velázquez.It is sometimes supposed that the young man is a portrait of El Greco's son, who was, however, at least thirty years old at that time	GRECO, El	View and Plan of Toledo	Oil on canvas, 132 x 228 cm	c. 1610	landscape	Spanish	1551-1600
09642-grotesq1.jpg	This painting (and another in the same private collection) are illuminating examples of the type of decorative flower pieces in series in which De la Corte specialised. The complete series is likely to have comprised a number of other pictures of the same type. These pictures are trompe l'oeil works that depict fictive carved stone or stucco-work grotesques of scrolling vegetable ornament with intertwining flower garlands. It is unlikely that these grotesques existed as such and they were most probably copied from 16th or 17th-century ornamental prints.While the grotesques are repeated in each picture, the floral arrangements vary and offer a delightful interplay between the natural-looking flowers and the stylised vegetable ornaments. The repetition of the grotesque decorations and the downward-looking angle of the cherubs gaze in the paintings suggest that these pictures were intended to make up a frieze on the upper part of the wall in a private residence of the time.

03935-stbernar.jpg	Jacopo Bellini had more than one opportunity to observe St Bernardino (1380-1444) and hear him preach. His portrait gives us a close-up view of the saint who stands before a velvet cloth decorated with thistle leaves and Christ's monogram. The saint's mouth is open, displaying three small teeth, and his eyes are directed downward toward a crucifix. The saint is shown as a living, speaking presence, perhaps the first such portrait of the Renaissance.The Sienese preacher St Bernardino, a prominent figure in the reform branch of the Franciscan order known as the Observants, was widely portrayed. In addition to a death mask, there are medals, standing and bust-length painted depictions, terracotta busts and statues, and engravings. Following his canonization in 1450, he was shown repeatedly in altarpieces	BELLINI, Jacopo	St Bernardino da Siena	Tempera on wood, 30 x 21 cm	1450-55	religious	Italian	1401-1450
07486-16martha.jpg	The painting has an iconographically very unusual theme. It shows Martha reproaching Mary Magdalene for her vanity, a subject that we know through a series of copies. The painting at Detroit has recently been recognized as the original.The religious theme is treated in a substantially profane manner. It is a pretext for making passages of highly intensive painting and for constructing an image that, seen in the context of the usual dichotomy of Caravaggio's early years, is more of a genre scene than a religious one	CARAVAGGIO	Martha and Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 98 x 133 cm	c. 1598	religious	Italian	1551-1600
42149-conquest.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.The iconographic theme of the hall of the Sala dello Scrutinio was inspired by the Venetian naval victories on the Eastern seas shown in the numerous ceiling canvases depicting virtues and symbolic figures. Vassilacchi's Conquest of Tyre on the wall of the Sala del Scrutinio depicts a historical event which occurred in 1123 under the rule of Doge Domenico Michiel, who commanded the Venetian fleet in the East	VASSILACCHI, Antonio	Conquest of Tyre	Oil on canvas	c. 1590	historical	Italian	1551-1600
41878-vendra01.jpg	This villa is typical of the Veneto Region with gardens and decorative murals. It was owned by the Grimani family for more than 200 years and bequeathed to the comune by its last private owner, Elena Vendramin Calergi (married Andrea Valmarana in 1826). It is now the seat of The Valmarana foundation named for her.The villa underwent extensive renovations in 1757 on the occasion of the marriage of Francesco Vendramin Grimani Calergi and Bianca Morosini. This was the time when Andrea Urbani was engaged to fresco the portego (the large ground-floor room that traverses the building from front to back) and the seven rooms on the second floor.The decoration of the portego is limited to the walls, on which there are three large landscapes set within ornate, faux architectural settings, also designed by Urbani. The west wall contains View of a Villa with a Pool and Landscape with Waterfall, while the opposite wall has View of a Large Renaissance Palace, divided into two parts by the staircase door. In the centre foreground of each landscape, on a trompe-l'oeil pedestal, is a faux-bronze statuary group representing the struggle between Good and Evil	URBANI, Andrea	View of the portego	Fresco	1764-68	interior	Italian	1751-1800
06288-backoper.jpg	The figures in Brouwer's later pictures, produced after he had settled in Antwerp, are especially animated in gesture and expression, manifesting an unprecedented display of skill matched only by the sophisticated style in which they were painted. The Back Operation is an outstanding representative of Brouwer's late style. The artist has intensified the monochromatic effects of his earlier works, rendering them in a higher key than previously, and he has reduced his composition to just three figures who proportionally occupy a significant area of the interior space	BROUWER, Adriaen	The Back Operation	Oil on panel, 34 x 27 cm	1635-36	genre	Flemish	1601-1650

19482-1portrai.jpg	The companion-piece of this painting, the portrait of Pieter Bicker Gerritsz. is also in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.The traditional identification of the couple is probably incorrect, the two portraits represent a young and hard-working couple, they were painted probably to mark their betrothal	HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van	Portrait of Anna Codde	Oil on panel, 86 x 66 cm	1529	portrait	Dutch	1501-1550
20473-emmaus.jpg	The painter represented this subject in two paintings (in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and in the Hermitage).

15337-jupiter.jpg	The composition of this painting is clearly related to a work by Luca Giordano depicting the Sleeping Venus with Cupid and a Satyr in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. Given the great popularity of Giordano's work in Florence, it is conceivable that Gherardini knew the composition of Venus with Cupid and a Satyr through other versions or drawings, and presented it in his own idiom	GHERARDINI, Alessandro	Jupiter and Antiope	Oil on canvas, 150 x 193	-	mythological	Italian	1651-1700

06087-taylor_s.jpg	Quiringh van Brekelenkam worked in Leiden, where he was influenced by Dou's domestic subjects and by Metsu's broad touch and intense colours. He is best known for his paintings of men and women artisans working at various crafts: cobblers, lace makers, spinners, fish mongers, and so forth. Outstanding is his Tailor's Shop of 1653 at the Worcester Art Museum where he finds quiet poetry in a view of a humble interior with the master and his two apprentices at work, seated tailor-fashion on the table while an old woman prepares a meal. Thirteen variations of the Worcester painting have been recorded (fine ones are at Amsterdam, London, Philadelphia, and Bonn); an indication that there must have been a good market for the motif. Like so many genre painters of his time, he turned to more elegant subjects in the sixties	BREKELENKAM, Quiringh van	Interior of a Tailor's Shop	Oil on canvas, 55 x 75 cm	1653	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

13281-l_dacre.jpg	Eworth was a portraitist originated from Antwerpen. He worked from 1549 in England. His predecessor in the royal court was Hans Holbein the Younger who strongly influenced his style. This is well illustrated by the portrait of Lady Dacre	EWORTH, Hans	Portrait of Lady Dacre	Oil on wood, 74 x 58 cm	1540	portrait	Flemish	1551-1600
28339-pitti1.jpg	The architectonical elements of quadratura, or trompe-l'oeil, decoration provide the grand duke's Private Audience Hall with startling illusionistic effects. On its rear wall Mitelli painted a grand double staircase that visually enlarges the actual size of the room through a deceptive perspectival device. The figure of a court official, painted by Mitelli's partner Angelo Michele Colonna (c. 1600-1687) is seen in the act of climbing the imaginary stairs, thus adding a sense of illusionary reality.In the Palazzo Pitti commission the Colonna-Mitelli collaboration developed a successful model that the pair was able to translate to other situations. The best example of this is the painting, from a few years later, in the salone of the d'Este summer residence in Sassuolo, near Modena	MITELLI, Agostino	View of the Sala dell'Udienza del Granduca	Fresco	1636-41	interior	Italian	1601-1650

05055-landscap.jpg	During his lifetime Bonzi was particularly renowned for his still-lifes, but, like Filippo Napoletano, he was also active as a painter of landscapes. His output in this genre became entangled with that of Agostino Tassi, even though the two do not really have much in common. In addition to this canvas, Bonzi's certain works include The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and The Rest of Hercules (both in the Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome), Nymph and Faun (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini, Rome) and Latona and the Frogs (Musée du Louvre, Paris).Bonzi was clearly influenced by Annibale Carracci and to an even greater extent by Domenichino, but his compositions are more open on both sides and his terrain much flatter. His foregrounds spread out freely without obstacles such as large rocks or bushes, almost inviting the viewer to walk into the picture. His rather awkward figures tend to move parallel to the picture plane in a frieze-like procession. In the early 1620s he worked at the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal hill with Filippo Napoletano, each decorating different rooms. In this landscape Bonzi's close attention to naturalistic detail suggests the influence of Bril. Establishing a chronology for Bonzi's landscapes is almost impossible, but this work is perhaps not too far in date from the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi frescoes. The shepherds' nakedness indicates that the scene is not contemporary (even though sheep-farming had largely replaced cultivation in the Roman campagna around this time), but rather an episode from Virgil's Arcadia	BONZI, Pietro Paolo	Landscape with Shepherds and Sheep	Oil on canvas, 47 x 64 cm	c. 1621	landscape	Italian	1601-1650

28386-bearded.jpg	The sitter is most probably the artist's father, Giovan Battista Mola who himself was an architect. It appears as if the artist has portrayed his father as a biblical figure or a philosopher.

39994-3redhea4.jpg	There are very different types of woman in Lautrec's female gallery, with whom he had more or less lasting relationships. They tend to remain anonymous, known only by their first name, or by their portraits, which are rich in psychological, humorous human perceptions. Most of them are red-heads, for Lautrec had a passion for red hair. Between 1888 and 1891 he painted them all obsessively	TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de	The Toilet	Oil on cardboard, 67 x 54 cm	1889	genre	French	1851-1900

34916-1auxerr1.jpg	In St. Stephen's Chapel in the crypt of Saint-Germain in Auxerre, the visitor is confronted by a surprising composition: the stoning of St. Stephen is depicted in a tympanum. It illustrates, inspired by the text from the Acts of the Apostles (6:12), the final phase of the appearance of St. Stephen before his judges. In the middle of the trial he has a vision and declares that God has appeared to him. Then accused of blasphemy, he is stoned to death.Nearly all of the left-hand half of the picture is taken up by the representation  of a town which is scaled down in size in proportion to the figures. St. Stephen has just been dragged through this city gate and onto the place of his execution. Towering behind the humble St. Stephen, his torturers are depicted with their arms raised up ready to throw the stones. The figure of St. Stephen himself projects into the right half of the picture which otherwise consists of an empty space, broken up to great effect by the appearance of the hand of God	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French	Stoning of St Stephen	Fresco	c. 800	religious	French	0751-0800

00468-sisera.jpg	This painting relates the story of Jael and Sisera in tones of delicate colours that contrast emphatically with the drama of the biblical event recounted. It was painted after the artist's return too Venice from travels that took him to most of Europe, when his palette became brighter and more refined.Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Jael and Sisera	Oil on canvas	c. 1739	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
19439-stil_lif.jpg	"De Heem's still-life paintings initially followed the style of the Haarlem school, but later drew closer to the more lavish Flemish style of large-scale still-lifes. Nevertheless, certain Dutch elements cannot be overlooked. In this painting, they are particularly evident at the points where a ""dialectical principle"" determines the compositional structure.A mass of fruit and flowers ranging from ripe chestnuts to blackberries, from columbine to roses, has been arranged on a stone slab. A wide variety of surfaces, each with a different effect in light, with pure or iridescent colours, is spread out before us. Yet snails are already crawling across the vine leaves, the foliage is discoloured and withering and, the ears of grain are curling, the peach has burst its skin, the citrus fruit is half peeled, the white carnation is dried and drooping over the table edge.At the very point where the image bears an iconographic message of the transience of worldly life in the form of nature's riches, we see these things in their last bloom of beauty. Just as a ruin could represent the picturesque appeal of architecture, so too can a vine leaf riddled with snails seem picturesque in the full and final flowering of its beauty"	HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de	Still-Life	Oil on panel, 56 x 74 cm	-	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650

32214-19midas.jpg	In Greek legend Midas was a king of Phrygia who was granted a wish by Bacchus in return for a good deed he had done to Silenus, a follower of the god. Midas wished that everything he touched be turned to gold, but soon realized his mistake when all food became inedible. Bacchus ordered him to wash in the River Pactolus in Lydia. Hence the popular aetiology of the gold-bearing properties of the river, thought to have been the source of wealth of the kings of Lydia, of whom Croesus was the last.Midas is depicted penitently before Bacchus, a drunken Silenus sleeping nearby.

30863-keys.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Likely in charge of the entire project of the fresco decoration on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, Pietro Perugino retained for himself not only representations on the altar wall (which eventually were replaced by Michelangelo's Last Judgment) but also other significant scenes, such as Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, a most fitting subject for Pope Sixtus' chapel. The fresco is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the gold and silver keys to the kneeling St Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open piazza is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles, although they are not used in defining the spatial organization. Nor is the relationship between the figures and the felicitous invention of the porticoed Temple of Salomon that dominates the picture effectively resolved. The triumphal arches at the extremities appear as superfluous antiquarian references, suitable for a Roman audience. Scattered in the middle distance are two secondary scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right.The style of the figures is dependent upon Verrocchio. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to  minor detail.The octagonal temple with its ample porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael	PERUGINO, Pietro	Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter	Fresco, 335 x 550 cm	1481-82	religious	Italian	1451-1500
10630-riverban.jpg	Cuyp's earliest dated landscapes of 1639 are astonishingly eclectic, but by 1641 he was painting panoramic views of the Dutch countryside in the monochromatic mode of van Goyen. The young Cuyp, however, favoured a distinct yellow tonality as against van Goyen greyish and brown hues. More important for Cuyp's subsequent development was the impact of Dutch landscapists who brought an Italianate style from Rome back to Holland; Cuyp himself never travelled to the south.Since very few of Cuyp's landscapes are dated, and none is dated after 1645, it is difficult to say precisely when the characteristic golden light, reminiscent of the Campagna the artist never saw, replaces the earlier paler one, and when mountain ranges, herds of cattle, and figures conspicuously set off against a sky begin to play an important role in his compositions. But by 1645 distinct traces of the style of Cornelis Poelenburgh, a member of the first generation of Italianate painters, and Jan Both, the leading artist of the following generation of Italianate landscapists, are evident. Jan Both became Cuyp's principal source of inspiration. The River-bank with Cows shows how rapidly he assimilated Both's motifs and sun-drenched light. From this time onward golden sunlight becomes the all-pervading element in Cuyp's paintings. It spreads warmth and beauty over the Dutch countryside, where sturdy animals - most often cows - take place of human heroes	CUYP, Aelbert	River-bank with Cows	Oil on canvas	c. 1650	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
37371-moret1.jpg	Sisley went tirelessly in search of motifs along the Seine and its tributaries, he looked no further. He abided by views of village streets, or of interesting groups of buildings, he would be drawn to an old stone bridge, the kind of subject that had fascinated painters since Corot. In unprepossessing patches of gardens or meadows, landscapes on the skirts of towns or along river banks, he could often discover the most arresting colour or light effects	SISLEY, Alfred	Moret-sur-Loing in Morning Sun	Oil on canvas, 61 x 74 cm	1888	landscape	French	1851-1900

29886-isaac.jpg	The painter stayed in Italy at the height of Caravaggio's popularity, and the influence of Caravaggio can be seen in this painting.

32451-sebastia.jpg	This canvas is the creative legacy of Mattia Preti's stay in Naples. The picture clearly takes off Caravaggio's light as its point of departure. The refined way in which it is painted, however, as well as the use of elegant details and the classically-inspired pose of the saint's statuesque body bathed in a ray of light are all extremely revealing about the painter's extensive and important travels. In fact, Preti amalgamated the most disparate influences with great originality	PRETI, Mattia	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas, 240 x 169 cm	c. 1656	religious	Italian	1651-1700
14981-1paris02.jpg	The Moon and the Earth is Gauguin's depiction of an ancient Polynesian myth, in which Hina, the female spirit of the Moon, implores Fatou, the male spirit of the Earth, to grant humans eternal life. It is a request Fatou resolutely denies. The painting was included in the exhibition that Gauguin organized at Durand-Ruel's gallery in Paris in November 1893. The works exhibited were his most recent: a few sculptures, three paintings from Brittany and 41 from Tahiti. In the end, only 11 paintings were sold and the artist Degas bought Hina te Fatou	GAUGUIN, Paul	Hina te Fatou (The Moon and the Earth)	Oil on canvas, 112 x 61 cm	1893	mythological	French	1851-1900

In fact, biting one's hand is a traditional symbol of envy, one of Cain's seven sins. In the medallion of the grotesque decor below, a murder scene with Triton-like creatures is depicted. Here the murder weapon is the jawbone of an ass, the one used by Cain in killing his brother Abel.This fresco fragment was discovered during a recent restoration	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Fresco fragment	Fresco	1499-1502	other	Italian	1451-1500
18886-abraham.jpg	Guercino is one of the most interesting personalities in seventeenth-century Bolognese art, and his activity in Rome made him an important influence on all Italian painting. More than from Venice and Correggio, his work derives from Dosso Dossi and the school of Ferrara. This painting represents one of the high points of Guercino's mature style. Its restoration by the Brera's laboratory has revealed the original colours and eliminated the yellowish patina that obfuscated and partially hid the composition.The painting is built up on a measured circular rhythm, and the prominent gestures of the figures are emphasized almost to the point of theatricality. Little Ishmael is crying and leaning his head against Hagar. As she consoles him and holds out a handkerchief, she turns toward Abraham, who stands stern and still, making a gesture of repudiation. Sarah, seen from behind, appears to be moving away from the scene. The low-keyed colour helps avoid any rhetorical suggestion, while the slow rhythm of the composition creates a sense of inevitability.The city of Cento commissioned this painting, which was then presented to the Cardinal Legate of Ferrara, Lorenzo Imperiali	GUERCINO	Abraham Casting Out Hagar and Ishmael	Oil on canvas, 115 x 154 cm	1657	religious	Italian	1601-1650

21387-lycomed2.jpg	This subject is rare in seventeenth-century Northern Netherlandish art. However, it became extremely popular in Flanders after Rubens' version appeared in c. 1616. There are three known versions of the theme by Lairesse: in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig.The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Knowing her son was destined to die if he went to fight in the Trojan war, Thethis, a sea nymph, disguised Achilles as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes, in whose palace on the isle of Scyros he lived among the king's daughters. Odysseus and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch Achilles. They cunningly laid a heap of gifts before the girls - jewellery, clothes and other finery, but among them a sword, spear and shield. When a trumpet was sounded, Achilles instinctively snatched up the weapons and thus betrayed his identity.Lairesse, like all other artists who rendered the subject, chose the scene Achilles examining the weapons	LAIRESSE, Gérard de	Achilles Discovered among the Daughters of Lycomedes	Oil on canvas, 150 x 181 cm	c. 1685	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

16821-2cesari1.jpg	The Camerino dei Cesari (Chamber of the Caesars) was perhaps the most famous room in Federico Gonzaga's apartment in the Palazzo Ducale. Giulio Romano designed the complex decoration of this room, which centred on frescoed scenes of classical subjects on the vault, now only partially preserved; the series of stuccoed niches around the upper part of the wall, which contained bronze statues, and the famous series of eleven Roman emperors painted by Titian between 1536 and 1540.

38055-sanmarco.jpg	Antonio Stom was a Northern European painter who painted Venetian views in the early decades of the 18th century.

36801-crisosto.jpg	This altarpiece depicts St John Chrysostom with Sts Catherine, Magdalen, Lucy, John the Evangelist, John the Baptist and Theodore. It is a painting with an official, doctrinal message, based on the association of the three Johns. Chrysostom is sitting side on, not in compliance with any mannerist idiosyncrasy but simply to enable us to see and read the book of his golden Word.The altarpiece has at the centre an old man reading, oblivious of the saints around him. It is a tightly knit and crowded group, the slightly yearning figure of St John the Baptist on the right looking inwards is balanced by a trio of grandly assured, superb Venetian beauties looking forwards and outwards at the spectator. The figures are in an architectural setting.This altarpiece is the major work of Sebastiano executed in Venice before he removed to Rome permanently in 1511	SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO	San Giovanni Crisostomo Altarpiece	Oil on canvas, 200 x 156 cm	1510-11	religious	Italian	1501-1550
22597-6madsain.jpg	The work probably dates from the artist's early career. It may be the first indoor sacra conversazione in the history of Italian painting.In Florence in the first half of the fifteenth century the market for devotional images was dominated by sculpture, not painting. Consequently, sculptural reliefs exerted a profound influence on painted compositions of the Madonna and Child. This early painting by Filippo Lippi takes its inspiration from a marble relief from the workshop of Donatello (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) that also exists in molded versions	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	Madonna and Child with Saints, Angels, and a Donor	Panel, 47 x 36 cm	c. 1437	religious	Italian	1401-1450
28703-stilife.jpg	Monnoyer was, in his prime in the 1670s, the foremost still-life painter in Europe, but his skill has been much underestimated in recent years, due to the proliferation of incorrect attributions to him. He specialized in flower pieces of the most elaborate design, although in the early part of his career he produced more conventional still-life paintings, such as the one in the Musée Fabre at Montpellier.The painting was executed in 1665 and submitted to the Academy at the time of the painter's admission in the same year. Following the upheavals of the Revolution in 1789, it was deposited at Montpellier in 1804.

42052-betrotha.jpg	Between 1360 and 1370 Lippo Vanni executed a cycle of fresco paintings for the church of the rural hermitage of San Leonardo al Lago just outside Siena. Painted on the walls and entrance arch of the chancel of this church, the scheme includes narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin, such as the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, the Annunciation, the Betrothal of the Virgin, and the Assumption of the Virgin (over the chancel arch, now badly damaged)	VANNI, Lippo	The Betrothal of the Virgin	Fresco	1360s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
03825-112madon.jpg	The painting, which has been in Bergamo since the 16th century, probably formed part of the dowry of the Carmelite nun Lucrezia Agliardi Vertova, abbess of the Sant'Anna monastery at Albino.On the parapet in front of the Virgin, a detail present in many other similar compositions, there is a fruit. Like the walled and many-towered city on the right, and the inlet on the left, it is a symbol referring to the Virgin, according to the attributes assigned to her by hymns, analects and lauds ever since the Middle Ages. The mother and child are linked, more than by the tender embracing gesture, by the rapt, reflective gaze with which the Madonna engulf her son. The painting is the prototype from which various similar compositions derive, such as the Madonna and Red Angels of the Accademia in Venice, with the child seated on the Virgin's left knee	BELLINI, Giovanni	Madonna and Child	Oil on panel, 83 x 66 cm	1480-90	religious	Italian	1451-1500

15735-ceiling.jpg	With the Peace of Bratislava (1805), Venice was incorporated into the French Empire. It was decided that a new sovereign's residence was required for Napoleon and the viceroy, Eugène de Beauharnais. Once the idea of converting the Palazzo Ducale had been abandoned, the notion was mooted to use the Procuratie Nuove and the Libreria Marciana for this purpose.Apart from Giuseppe Borsato, there were also a number of famous non-Venetians involved in decorating the royal palace. Felice Giani was given the task of painting the new apartment for the viceroy made out of the Libreria Marciana. His figures, full of self-confidence enlivened by quick-witted elements set against the whimsical ornamental scheme by Gaetano Bertolani, contain references to Herculaneum and neo-Renaissance motifs.The picture shows the ceiling decoration for the viceroy's apartment in the former Libreria Marciana	GIANI, Felice	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	1813	other	Italian	1801-1850
19908-06henry8.jpg	"This painting was one of a group of English portraits carried out by Holbein and his school. Though German, Holbein was court painter to King Henry VIII of England, and the prototype for this image is his lost mural that once decorated the Privy Chamber of Whitehall Palace in London. Carried out in 1537, that wall painting depicted the king with his third wife Jane Seymour, the only one of Henry's queens to bear him a male heir. Of the numerous paintings derived from that prototype, including a copy at Windsor Castle, this is without doubt the one of highest quality. The closest example to the prototype, on the other hand, is the portrait in the Thyssen collection in Madrid, which this version approaches especially in the rendering of the details of the collar (these passages were later modified, as is visible through reflectography).The Barberini portrait depicts the king in the same costume that he wore for his April, 1540, wedding to Anne of Cleves. The painting can thus be related to Duren's 1539 marriage portrait of Anne of Cleves (Louvre Museum, Paris), carried out in small dimensions and on canvas as it was meant to be transported.The attribution of the Rome version has been the subject of much discourse. It was considered to be an autograph work of Holbein, a copy of a lost original, the work of the master's workshop, the work of a close collaborator. An official engraving cut after this composition (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), adherent in its details to the Barberini picture, confirms the importance of this version of the image to the iconography of the king. Moreover, reflectographic examination of the painting has revealed characteristic underdrawing and other details that strongly suggest that the work is an autograph Holbein.The painting bears the inscription ""ANNO ETATIS SUAE XLIX"" (His year of age, 49)."

32185-ricardus.jpg	Two Flemish court painters of Bruges descent who earned their reputation abroad, Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569-1622) and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1562-1636), were active at the close of the sixteenth century and especially in the first quarter of the seventeenth. They are linear descendants of famous Bruges painter families. Their solid, old-fashioned technique and the rigid, immovable expression of their figures seem more like an extension of the sixteenth century than a herald of the seventeenth.Frans Pourbus the Younger was Pieter Pourbus' grandson. He was trained in Antwerp and worked briefly for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella before going on to become court painter at Mantua, under Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, and in Paris, under Marie de' Medici and Louis XIII. Until about 1600, Pourbus painted in the smooth and technically brilliant style established by his grandfather, which he augmented with an analytical realism attributable to Adriaan Key. The Portrait of Petrus Ricardus, a famous doctor and professor at the University of Leuven, is a good example of his first period	POURBUS, Frans the Younger	Portrait of Petrus Ricardus	Oil on oak panel, 107 x 77 cm	1592	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

30311-maggiore.jpg	Pannini was one of the most accomplished vedutisti (view-painters) of the eighteenth century. He came from a long tradition of Emilian view-painters and scenery-painters. In 1715 he moved to Rome where he first worked as a decorator painting counterfeit architecture in various palaces. He then found a fuller creative voice by painting scenes of holidays or special events. The spectacular backdrops he used for these works were the squares and buildings of Rome. The beauty of these monumental backgrounds, bathed in clear light that seemed to exalt the very notion of the Eternal City, was so powerful that he had no need of a narrative pretext for them. Many of Pannini's paintings are simple views animated by lively little figures. He had a considerable influence on Canaletto and the great Venetian view-painters of the eighteenth century.

35394-05resur.jpg	Rubens painted this triptych, called Moretus triptych, in 1611-12, shortly after completing the Raising of the Cross, and at more or less the same time as the centre panel of the Descent from the Cross. Martina Plantin, widow of the printer Jan Moretus of the Plantin Press, placed the commission.Christ strides powerfully from his open, rocky tomb rather than the customary sarcophagus. The supernatural radiance of his body contrasts with the darkness that shrouds the astounded soldiers. The panel on the left shows John the baptist, Jan Moretus' patron saint, in his camel-hair tunic by the River Jordan. The sword at his feet is an allusion to his beheading. St Martina, patron saint of Moretus' widow, holds the palm branch that symbolises the martyr.

24109-95magi.jpg	Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame.The subject of Adoration of the Magi was one of the most popular in all fifteenth-century art, especially for the opportunities it presented for the display of rich costumes and accessories, and of numerous subordinate figures with horses and other animals in an extensive landscape. Mantegna, however, restricts his composition to just six figures - with the three magi on the right converging on the three members of the Holy Family on the left - which he shows in half-length, and hence, too, in powerfully expressive close-up. Four decades earlier, when still working as a young man in Padua, Mantegna had introduced this type of half-length devotional narrative into Italian painting with his Presentation in the Temple.It was suggested that this painting was executed for Isabella d'Este, the consort of Marquis Francesco Gonzaga	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Adoration of the Magi	Distemper on canvas, 55 x 71 cm	1495-1505	religious	Italian	1451-1500
16534-s_jerome.jpg	This panel is from the upper register of a reconstructed polyptych. The companion panels in the upper register show Sts Sebastian and Peter, the Crucifixion and St Lawrence. The main panels with which the upper register has been framed since 1925 represent the Madonna and Child with angels, flanked by, on the left, Sts Augustine and Catherine of Alexandria and, on the right, Sts Appolonia and Nicholas of Tolentino.St Jerome is the most moving of the figural panels in the upper register. He is shown with his symbol, the lion, placing its paws on the saint while licking him as would a dog. Jerome is scrutinizing the text of the Vulgate, which he holds in front of him. Staring at the text through gilded pince-nez, his brows knitted in concentration, he reads aloud, his mouth half open, revealing white teeth.The panels forming the upper register come from the Benedictine abbey in Gualdo Tadino, which must have been the original location of the altarpiece to which they belonged	GIOVANNI ANGELO D'ANTONIO	St Jerome	Tempera and gold on panel, 154 x 43 cm	1463-64	religious	Italian	1451-1500

23397-8bathing.jpg	Painting nudes was one of the favourite genres of Károly Lotz, especially during the 1890s he painted several nudes. His female nudes are generally very sensuous, with natural beauty radiating from their gestures. This particular nude is a little abstract; her posture, the cape over the shoulder, and the black stone vessel are reminiscent of the cool grace of Ingres's nudes	LOTZ, Károly	Bathing Woman	Oil on canvas, 180 x 70 cm	1901	other	Hungarian	1851-1900
11256-103delac.jpg	The first of Delacroix's paintings to achieve true notoriety, Dante and Virgil in Hell or The Barque of Dante, exemplifies a duality that pervaded his entire career. The shared influence of Michelangelo and Rubens is manifest here, but there is also a savour of the revolution so thunderously proclaimed by his friend and elder, Theodore Géricault, in his immortal painting, The Raft of the Medusa (1819).The Barque of Dante was submitted to the Salon in 1822, and makes clear acknowledgement of its debt to Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa. Indeed, the influence of that painting can be traced for many years afterwards in Delacroix's work, for example, in his Christ on the Lake of Gennesaret (1854) or The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840). The 'stage-setting' of The Barque of Dante looks forward to Baudelaire's pronouncement that Delacroix is an 'essentially literary' painter. But Delacroix had something much more important to leam from the Raft. In expressing the predicament of the shipwrecked everywhere in the world, Géricault had laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution. The Raft of the Medusa marks the first appearance in painting of 'the ugly' and thereby proclaims its scrupulous respect for the truth, however repulsive the truth might be. This concern for truth is integral to the Romantic temperament.	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	The Barque of Dante	Oil on canvas, 189 x 246 cm	1822	other	French	1801-1850

35185-portuga1.jpg	Antonio Rossellino and his workshop played an important role in the creation of the burial chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal. This elaborate undertaking was the result of the collaboration of an architect (Antonio Manetti), four sculptors (Antonio Rossellino, his brothers Bernardo and Giovanni, and Luca della Robbia), three painters (Alesso Baldovinetti, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo), their workshops, and other craftsmen as well, and yet the chapel today - which looks exactly as it must have looked in the 1470s - is a stylistically unified totality rather than a demonstration of the diverse talents of a number of individuals.James (Jaime), a prince of the Portugal royal family who was made a cardinal at twenty-two, died of tuberculosis in Florence when he was only twenty-five. He had expressed a desire to be buried at San Miniato, and immense sums poured in for his funerary chapel.The chapel was designed by Antonio Manetti, a pupil of Brunelleschi, and the architectural detail was carved by Giovanni Rossellino, third of the five Rossellino brothers. The tomb was designed by Antonio Rossellino, who was helped in the execution by his brother Bernardo, and several assistants. On the altar wall Antonio del Pollaiuolo's frescoed angels pull back curtains that can be related to the curtains that surround Rossellino's tomb on the right wall. The painted altarpiece representing three saints is a work by Antonio del Pollaiuolo (presently a copy, the original being in the Uffizi). On the left wall facing the tomb (not shown in this picture), Alesso Baldovinetti's Annunciation is placed. Baldovinetti decorated also the lunettes and spandrels of the chapel. The inlaid marble floor copies the Cosmati work found in the adjacent church; this pattern is echoed in the composition of Luca della Robbia's enamelled terracotta dome above, which has five medallions representing the Cardinal Virtues and the Descent of the Holy Ghost	ROSSELLINO, Antonio	View of the Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal	White and coloured marbles, width of chapel 480 cm	1460-73	interior	Italian	1451-1500

14432-106fried.jpg	The Cross in the Mountains (The Tetschen Altar) brought Friedrich to the attention of a wider public. Probably at no other point in his life did Friedrich enjoy more profound appreciation and greater admiration than in the years around 1810. Two landscapes in particular were responsible for thrusting Friedrich into the limelight. In 1810 they were exhibited as pendants at the Academy exhibition in Berlin, where they were purchased by the Prussian king Frederick William III. These two paintings were The Monk by the Sea and the Abbey in the Oakwood.The Abbey in the Oakwood is an expression of grief at the loss of a great past. The artist has chosen to depict an architectural ruin; it may testify to the sublimity of the past, but it is a monument in a graveyard.The Napoleonic invasion of Germany and the consequent War of Liberation had added a patriotic dimension to Friedrich's subjects of north German ecclesiastical buildings in ruins or, in imagination, raised again. While the essential message of the Abbey in the Oak-wood of 1810 is the passing of the earthly life, its fog-bound ruin and blasted, leafless trees inevitably evoked the contemporary state of Germany.The painting was exhibited with its companion picture, the Monk by the Sea. This suggests the hope of resurrection in its bright sky, in contrast to the dark clouds that loom above the figure on his Baltic shore	FRIEDRICH, Caspar David	The Abbey in the Oakwood	Oil on canvas, 110 x 171 cm	1809-10	landscape	German	1801-1850

14039-altarpie.jpg	Formerly in Santa Maria delle Grazie at Bergamo, it was removed to the Brera in 1811. The predella and the crowning panel were acquired from the Albani collection in 1811. It is not certain that the predella and the crowning element originally formed part of the same altarpiece; and the accuracy of the entire reconstruction is in doubt. The panels are the following:Central panel: Madonna and Child (165 x 80 cm); side panels: Sts Jerome, Alexander, Vincent, Anthony (137 x 39 cm each); upper side panels: Sts Clare, Bonaventura, Louis, Bernardino (126 x 40 cm each); upper centralaa panel: St Francis (128 x 82 cm); predella panels showing scenes from the Life of Christ (87 x 30 cm each) and two Angels in Adoration (27 x 29 cm each).This altarpiece belongs to Foppa's early stylistic maturity and retains the archaising tendency toward simplification of his youthful period, before he was influenced by Leonardo and Bramante. It also shows the pungent impetuosity of Mantegna's influence in the sharply drawn perspective, and in the tension and almost metallic consistency of the forms. In this resplendent altarpiece, the central panels are particularly fine examples of Foppa's masterly interweaving of colour and light. The Madonna's face, lightly thrown into relief, concludes a series of circling motifs enhanced by the elegant twist of the body of the Child, as he leans over to pluck the string of the lute. In the panel above, St Francis appears as a motionless, somewhat astonished figure immersed in the limpid air of a lyric landscape	FOPPA, Vincenzo	Altarpiece	Tempera on panel	1476	religious	Italian	1451-1500
23474-danishco.jpg	The painting shows a view from Kitnas on Roskilde Fjord, Zeeland. When the painter decided to depict a Danish coastline in an unusually monumental format, the scene was to represent the quintessential characteristic of the Danish countryside: the extensive coastlines. The scene does not, in fact, depict a single, specific site, the main motif is based on cliffs that the artist saw and sketched at the Roskilde Fjord. He adapted these cliffs, making them rather more monumental, and combined them with scenes from elsewhere	LUNDBYE, Johan Thomas	A Danish Coast	Oil on canvas, 189 x 256 cm	1843	landscape	Danish	1801-1850

20645-skagen.jpg	Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris, the modern metropolis with its many-sided art scene. They attended the school of Léon Bonnat, or the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-Léon Gérôme. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grèz-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.Johansen painted with Monet's influence still fresh. Sheep are grazing in the foreground, while on the horizon, which divides the picture in two, we see Skagen with its mill, lighthouse, and the yellow-painted houses with their red tiled roofs	JOHANSEN, Viggo	Near Skagen ?sterby after a Storm	Oil on canvas, 95 x 147 cm	1885	landscape	Danish	1851-1900
11933-painting.jpg	Doré is best known today for his book illustrations, but he himself was most committed to his work as a painter. In 1873-74 he visited Scotland, which inspired him to produce a number of landscapes, including this depiction of a steep gorge. This is a typical example of late Romanticism, a grandiose panoramic mountain landscape, its vast scale indicated by the tiny trees and animals on the slopes	DORÉ, Gustave	Gorge	Oil on copper, 109 x 170 cm	1878	landscape	French	1851-1900
11130-early21.jpg	"Horse racing, a sport of English origin, became popular on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century, and soon inspired such painters as Carle Vernet and Théodore Géricault, who were both influenced by English artists. It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators. This led to the At the Races in the Countryside.Degas never tires of the theme of the racecourse. On September 27, 1881, the newspaper ""Le Globe"" started publishing Major Muybridge's photographs of a galloping horse, and Degas used them for his sketches. The photographs showed that traditional English prints were inaccurate when depicting galloping horses with their front legs outstretched. This is how Degas painted the horses racing in the background of At the Races in the Countryside of 1869.Degas exhibited this moderately colourful work at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The race itself is in the background, the foreground is occupied by a family scene centred on a baby, with the nurse, mother, father and even the dog atop the box. The family is the Valpinçon family: the driver of the carriage is Degas's friend Paul Valpinçon, who is shown with his wife, a wet nurse, and in the nurse's lap, the couple's son, Henri.

33934-atalanta.jpg	In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions.In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her.There are two versions of this paining, one in Naples and another in Madrid, and recently there have been heated debates about both their autography and dating. While most scholars recognize the Madrid canvas as an autograph work, there have been serious reservations about the Neapolitan canvas, deemed it a workshop copy.

12114-du_barry.jpg	"Jeanne Bécu, comtesse du Barry (1743-1793), was the mistress of Louis XV. She was the natural daughter of a poor woman of Vaucouleurs. Placed in a convent in Paris at an early age, she received a very slight education, learning little but the catechism and drawing; and at the age of sixteen entered a milliner's shop in the rue St Honoré. Subsequently she lived as a courtesan under the name of Mlle Lange. Her great personal charms led the adventurer Jean, comte du Barry, to take her into his house in order to make it more attractive to the dupes whose money he won by gambling. Her success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a higher flight, and through Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV, and the duc de Richelieu, he succeeded in installing her as mistress of the king. In order to present her at court it was necessary to find a title for her, and as Count Jean du Barry was married, his brother Guillaume offered himself as nominal husband. The comtesse du Barry was presented at court on the 22nd of April 1769, and became official mistress of the king.Her influence over the monarch was absolute until his death in 1774 when an order of his successor banished her to the abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, but, the queen interceding for her, the king in the following year gave her permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Here she led a retired life with the comte de Cosse-Brissac, and was visited there by Benjamin Franklin and the emperor Joseph II, among many other distinguished men.Having gone to England in 1792 to endeavour to raise money on her jewels, she was on her return accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal of having dissipated the treasures of the state, conspired against the republic, and worn, in London, ""mourning for the tyrant."" She was condemned to death by guillotine on the 8th of December 1793, and beheaded the same evening.By the time the comtesse du Barry had arrived at Versailles, Drouais had completed posthumously the last portrait of Madame de Pompadour, a sumptuous affair that surely qualifies as his masterpiece. It was fitting that the new royal paramour would choose as her official portraitist an artist who could immortalize her predecessor with such refinement and elegance. She commissioned him to paint for both the ch&#226;teau and the pavilion of Luciennes a series of delightful pictures. During the comtesse du Barry's years at court, Drouais created five distinct portraits of her, as well as additional copies of the five images"	DROUAIS, François-Hubert	Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry	Oil on canvas, 71 x 59 cm	1770-74	portrait	French	1701-1750

03597-1trinity.jpg	In a theme that was majestically treated by Masaccio a century earlier, Beccafumi does not retain an orderly sense of scale for his figures, so that God the Father and the crucified Christ are much smaller in relation to the side saints (Sts Cosmas and John the Baptist at left, Sts John the Evangelist and Damian at right). All of his figures seem to deny pure volumetric presence, this despite the fact that Beccafumi was accomplished both as a bronze sculptor and painter	BECCAFUMI, Domenico	Trinity	Oil on wood, 152 x 228 cm	1513	religious	Italian	1501-1550
02618-03arella.jpg	While paintings of flowers in a vase represented the most conventional type of flower piece in the 17th century, in the pair of Vase of Flowers, now in the same private collection, Arellano has depicted particularly rich arrangements in remarkably ornate bulbous glass vases with gilt mounts. The paintings could be surrogates for actual flower arrangements in the homes of wealthy contemporaries.The apparently natural floral arrangements seen in these paintings were the result of Arellano's careful ordering of the flowers. He derived this type of composition from his study of earlier Flemish flower paintings and prints, and varied it little throughout his career. It is hard to distinguish the flowers he painted from nature from those deriving from other pictures, graphic sources, memory and practice.While the repetitive nature of Arellano's still-lifes would not have been noticed in his own time, when his works were dispersed among different collections, this factor is augmented in pictures united by photography and exhibitions	ARELLANO, Juan de	Vase of Flowers	Oil on canvas, 82 x 62,5 cm	1664	still-life	Spanish	1601-1650
10201-charity1.jpg	From 1529 Lucas Cranach the Elder, and his son Lucas the Younger depicted the Christian virtue of Love, Caritas or Charitas, in some dozen different versions. It happened only in individual pictures, where Caritas (Charity) does not appear in the company of the seven (or more) virtues and vices. The earlier clothed personification - the idealised figure of a woman - has been replaced by the picture of a young mother. She sits in blissful nakedness on a stone bench, her legs modestly crossed, with only a thin veil covering her head and shoulders. She breastfeeds her baby and allows two somewhat larger boys to cling on her.This composition later appeared in many other versions. The present version is amongst the earliest of Cranach's numerous variants of Caritas pictures.

The second, likewise a triumphal procession was finished a year later. Finally, in 1651, he painted a grisaille of putti.

06682-v_lawyer.jpg	Pieter Breughel the Younger (the sons adopted a different spelling of the family name) specialized in copies of his father's work, though he ought really to be pictured as the head of a workshop in which a number of painters were employed. Some of these were more talented than others, which explains the substantial differences in quality between the many copies ascribed to him. The Village Lawyer, dated 1621, is believed to be an original work by Pieter the Younger rather than a copy. It too proved very popular and many versions of it have survived	BRUEGHEL, Pieter the Younger	Village Lawyer	Oil on panel, 74,8 x 122 cm	1621	genre	Flemish	1551-1600
34269-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.Undoubtedly Sebastiano Ricci's dashing virtuoso technique had its roots in the Baroque. In his hands, however, it was translated into an explosive, light-hearted energy.	RICCI, Sebastiano	Fall of Phaethon	Oil on canvas	1703-04	religious	Italian	1701-1750

07213-canal501.jpg	The painting depicts the scene when the doge, accompanied by the senators, visits the church and Scuola di San Rocco on the occasion of the feastday of the Saint.The church of San Rocco at the right has housed the body of St Roch since 1485. In 1576 there was a very severe outbreak of the plague in Venice, and it was thought that his intercession prevented an even greater calamity, so from that year onwards his Feast day, 16 August, was celebrated by the Republic. Canaletto here depicts one aspect of the festivities - a procession of resplendent dignitaries emerging from the church after they have attended Mass.The Scuola di San Rocco dominates the centre of the composition; its exterior is decorated with garlands and paintings, as was the custom on this occasion. Canaletto and his artist nephew Bellotto are recorded as having sold some of their works at one of these exhibitions. Many of the figures walking before it and beneath the awning can be identified because of their distinctive and colourful clothes. They are, from left to right: Secretaries, who wear mauve; the Doge's chair- and cushion-bearers; the Cancelliere Grande who wears scarlet; the Doge himself in gold and ermine; the Guardiano Grande di San Rocco; the bearer of the sword of state; the Senators; and finally the Ambassadors.

10399-05adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht Dürer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike Dürer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Eve	Oil on lime wood panel, 171 x 63 cm	after 1537	religious	German	1501-1550
41182-zhairy1.jpg	"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome.

As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

29281-213muril.jpg	Murillo's Immaculada has nothing of a Queen of Heavens. Standing on a crescent moon, as described in the Apocalypse, surrounded by angels holding the mirror as a sign of purity and the palm frond as a sign of suffering, she stands in a relatively unaffected poses. Her face is pale, her eyes gaze upwards in yearning. We can sense the pain she has experienced and her mourning for her son. Quiet and introverted, she epitomises the humble anticipation of the hereafter, transfigured only by a mild smile, that is a hallmark of Murillo's paintings of this period; the 'Estilo vaporoso' - the vaporous style	MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban	Immaculate Conception	Oil on canvas, 96 x 64 cm	-	religious	Spanish	1651-1700

35291-youngirl.jpg	Pietro Rotari, born in Verona, was one of the Venetian Settecento masters who travelled extensively. His enchanting genre pieces, his half-length portraits of young girls enjoyed wide popularity, particularly in Vienna, Dresden and later in St. Petersburg, where the artist stayed for several years. He also painted large religious compositions and mythological scenes, but his fame rested on the small pictures usually produced in series, in which, as in the Budapest painting, a pretty young girl was represented with a distaff or reading a letter, perhaps slumbering or leaning over her book. In these works an appealing pose was coupled with fine, pure design and warm colouring	ROTARI, Pietro Antonio	Young Girl with Distaff	Oil on canvas, 48 x 39 cm	-	portrait	Italian	1701-1750

35735-waterfa.jpg	This is one of Ruisdael grandest landscapes.After Ruisdael had settled in Amsterdam about 1656-57 his compositions broaden, and a certain heaviness in the foreground disappears. The opening of the view suggests that he was impressed by Philips Koninck's panoramic views, but the fresh atmospheric effect, the brilliant glittering daylight which brightens the landscapes, the reflections, and vivid colours in the shadows are completely personal. In the late fifties Ruisdael also began to represent waterfalls in mountainous northern valleys, and in the sixties they became an important theme in his oeuvre. This motif was popularized by Allart van Everdingen after he returned to Holland in 1644 from a trip to Norway and Sweden, and Ruisdael, who never visited Scandinavia, derived his torrential falls in northern landscapes from Everdingen's art	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Landscape with Waterfall	Oil on canvas, 101 x 142 cm	c. 1670	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
09848-courb111.jpg	"The subtitle of the huge painting is Real Allegory of Seven Years of My Artistic and Moral Life. Courbet did not like to talk about his art, but made an exception for this work: ""It is the moral and physical story of my studio. ... it is the world that comes to be painted. .. .The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are... friends... On the left, the other world of trivial life...""In 1854, Courbet began work on The Studio which he would like to submit for the Exposition universelle. Courbet described the painting in a letter: ""I see society with its concerns and passions; it is the world that comes to be painted.... The scene takes place in my atelier in Paris. The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are the shareholders, that is, friends, workers, devotees of the art world. On the left, the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.""The Studio presents a completely original synthesis and a thoroughly unexpected confrontation. There is no parallel in Courbet's later career for this generous, indeed baroque, vision, in which models and minds come together. Courbet sought to present the studio as an overall image of the role of art. He declared the autonomy and subjectivity of his perception in the face of history and the real world, both of which he had in his own way summoned into the studio. The master of ceremonies is seen painting a landscape, a practice that was to become increasingly central during the rest of his life. Meanwhile, the notion of a group portrait as homage or allegory in the spirit of Frans Hals, Rembrandt or Philippe de Champaigne, is perfectly achieved.The painting was a success at the Exposition, however, it did not find a buyer, remaining rolled up in a corner of the rue Hautefeuille studio till 1881, when Courbet's sister Juliette, his sole heir, decided to sell it. By then it had become something of a burden. It raised 21,000 francs (some 3,200 euros). Only in 1920 was it acquired by the Louvre, finding its way to the Musée d'Orsay some sixty years later"	COURBET, Gustave	The Studio of the Painter	Oil on canvas, 359 x 598 cm	1855	genre	French	1851-1900

38536-2allegor.jpg	Abraham van den Tempel painted a series of three allegorical history pieces for the governors of the Lakenhal, or Clothmakers' Hall in Leiden between 1648 and 1651. The commission was a prestigious one, not only because of the size of the pictures, but also because they were history pieces to be displayed in a high ranking public building. The governors who commissioned the work were men of considerable stature, too. They were entrusted by the city fathers with the day-to-day management of one of Leiden's nine textile sectors, known in Dutch as 'neringen'. In this capacity they were responsible for the manufacture of and trade in worsted, a sector that was booming at the time. Their seat of office was the brand-new building which has been known to this day as the Lakenhal. They wanted classicist decorations worthy of their modern building.Regarding the series, Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden originally served as the overmantel, while the other two, Mars Banishes 'Nering' and The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' hung on the long wall beside one another. The latter two paintings form pendants, being the same size and related in subject-matter. The theme that connects them is 'nering', the term formerly used in Leiden for the production of and trade in textile.Whereas the Mars Banishes 'Nering' illustrates the misfortune caused by war, the painting The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' embodies the antithesis, where freedom, justice and peace foster trade and industry. Here Minerva and Mercury return as witnesses of the principal scene in which the Maid of Leiden stands on a step in her purple gown and crimson mantel and extends a hand to Nering, while Liberty, with her broken weapons and the hat symbolising freedom, kneels at her feet. Under her arm Nering clutches a bound volume containing the statutes establishing the worsted nering in 1638	TEMPEL, Abraham van den	The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering'	Oil on canvas, 207 x 267 cm	1651	historical	Dutch	1651-1700
03546-05family.jpg	This is perhaps the most famous painting by Bazille. It depicts a family in the shade on a terrace at Méric, near Montpellier in the south of France. The painting was accepted at the 1868 Salon. The picture, showing Bazille's parents and relations, conveys a sense of family and of social status, a particular lifestyle, and a fresh response to Nature and light; in painting it, Bazille was also out to convince his family of his ability as an artist	BAZILLE, Jean-Frédéric	Family Gathering	Oil on canvas, 152 x 230 cm	1867	portrait	French	1851-1900
25082-doctors.jpg	The attribution of the fresco is debated. Originally Vasari attributed it to Cimabue, however, this attribution was rejected at the end of the 18th century. Since then some critics attributed it to Pietro Cavallini or one of his followers; Jacopo Torriti or a follower, the young Giotto or a follower.  In the four compartments of the vault in the entrance bay the artist portrays the four Doctors of Church together with their scribes: in the south (at the top of the illustration) St Augustine and opposite him, St Ambrose; in the east (to the left) St Jerome, and in the west St Gregory. The architectural structures jut up from below into the gold background. The painter conveys a definite idea of the intellectual work of these saints through the great attention to detail and the perspectival accuracy.The picture shows the vault before the 1997 earthquake	MASTER of the Isaac Stories	Vault with the Church Fathers	Fresco	c. 1295	religious	Italian	1251-1300

42510-hagar_is.jpg	A series of recent studies has led to something of a new attitude towards Flemish painting in the 18th century. Until fairly recently, the art of this period was considered to be rather inferior, despite the high artistic output, because of its perceived lack of innovation. On the one hand, Flemish artists of the 18th century continued to live off the inheritance of Rubens, whose art seemed unsurpassable. Artists such as Pieter Jozef Verhaghen worked entirely in the tradition of Rubens, and although he spent a few years in Italy, there are few traces of this in his work. His Hagar and Ishmael banished by Abraham, painted for the abbey at Tongerlo, has all the outward characteristics of a baroque painting, but lacks Rubens expressiveness. Meanwhile, other artists had fallen under the spell of France with its trend-setting rococo artists. This development was, however, rather out of character with Flemish artistic tradition	VERHAGHEN, Pieter Jozef	Hagar and Ishmael Banished by Abraham	Oil on canvas, 168 x 195 cm	1781	religious	Flemish	1751-1800

16101-mary07.jpg	"In the upper section of the lunette above the chancel arch God the Father enthroned is painted, while the sides of the lunette are occupied by the scene of the Annunciation.The border between painted and real space appears to have been breached in Giotto's frescoes. This characterizes the representation of God the Father at the top of the triumphal arch wall above the entrance to the choir. The heavens have opened and ranks of angels surround God the Father on his throne. Amongst the angels, who move elegantly, the depiction of God, with his delicately shimmering, bright robes and his hieratic face, gives the impression of his belonging to a different sphere.This particular effect is also the result of a different painting technique: God the Father is not painted as a fresco on the wall, but in tempera on a wooden panel. This ""door"" was presumably opened during the mystery plays performed to celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation, in order that the dove of Annunciation could fly out. The representation of the Annunciation directly below it is an indication of this. In a magnificent way, Giotto here combines the real architecture of the church interior with feigned, painted architectural elements to create a meaningful unity. To the right and left of the arch, the angel and Mary kneel in their respective buildings. It is only through the connecting architecture that tension is maintained within the depiction of the Annunciation, even over this great, daring distance and separation of figures, and that God the Father &#151; at the top of the triumphal arch &#151; is also included in the action. As far as form and content were concerned, Giotto was even here entering new territory"	GIOTTO di Bondone	No. 13 God Sends Gabriel to the Virgin	Fresco, 230 x 690 cm	1306	religious	Italian	1301-1350
10212-2nymph1.jpg	The resurgence of Gothic linear rhythms is fundamental for the whole of Cranach's later work, in which the borderline between sacred and mundane art is blurred. He represented female saints as beautiful and elegant ladies in fashionable dress and covered with jewelry. His  Reclining River Nymph at the Fountain (1518 Leipzig) shows with what assurance he translated a Renaissance model - Giorgione's Venus - into his personal language of linear arabesque. This work inaugurated a long series of paintings of Venus, Lucretia, the Graces, the Judgment of Paris, and other subjects that serve as pretexts for the sensuous female nude, in which Cranach appears as a kind of 16th-century François Boucher. There exists several copy of this painting made by the workshop of Cranach.

08628-s_emmaus.jpg	This Supper at Emmaus has been attributed to Philippe de Champaigne, although some art historians consider it to be the work of his nephew and pupil Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne (1631-1681 or 1684). Both artists were born in Brussels and settled in Paris. The Rubensian influence in Champaigne's work is tempered by a classical purity informed by both the artistic influence of Nicolas Poussin and de Champaigne's Jansenist beliefs. The artist performed a number of commissions for the Jansenist monastery of Port Royal, near Paris, including a painting of The Supper at Emmaus, possibly the version in Ghent.

36142-february.jpg	"Sandrart, best known for his major art history published in 1675 under the title ""Teutsche Academie"" is one of the few artist-writers whose painterly oeuvre was on a par with his literary ambitions.For Prince Maximilian of Bavaria, Sandrart painted allegories of day and night as well as a cycle of twelve paintings of the months of the year for the dining room of the Old Palace in Schleissheim. The months, accompanied by verses, were widely distributed in the form of engravings. They are illustrated by life-size half figures set in landscapes or interiors and show characteristic activities associated with the respective seasons and surrounded by their natural attributes. November, under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius the hunter, shows a hunter's return. With his nervous dogs on a short leash and his catch slung over his shoulder, he is heading towards a castle in the middle distance. A keen wind tears the leaves from the trees and scatters them through the air.Landscape and genre, still-life and allegory are combined in a picture that epitomizes the month of November in concentrated form.

03437-08lucill.jpg	An extraordinary burst of light bounces off the characters, casting silky reflections on the robes and making the gold glimmer. The painter produced this masterpiece when he was well into his middle age. It gives us tremendous insight into his enormously innovative power which fell between popular realism and magical effects. It is astounding to think Jacopo Bassano was able to produce paintings of this stature when he was so removed from the major centres of art	BASSANO, Jacopo	St Valentine Baptizing St Lucilla	Oil on canvas	c. 1575	religious	Italian	1551-1600
21928-6carnat.jpg	"A work that would seem to evoke the sketches of a young Leonardo freed from Verrocchio's tutelage, though nevertheless still affected by a passion and taste for the soft textures and dazzle of solid material (as practiced in the workshop of the Florentine artist), is the Madonna sometimes referred to as the Madonna of the Carnation or ""Madonna of the flowers"".This painting is a free variant of the Benois Madonna in the Hermitage, being more complex in its composition and spatial arrangement, though perhaps somewhat highflown and less spontaneous. How it arrived at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, after its acquisition by a private German collector, is unknown to us. What is certain is that after a comprehensible, temporary attribution to Verrocchio or his shop, art critics subsequently almost universally assigned the painting to Leonardo, a jjudgment backed up by the most recent research. In fact, the richness of the drapery, the vastness of the mountain scenery with purple and gold hues tingeing the foothills of peaks that fade into the sky, the vitality of the cut flowers in the crystal vase and the softness of the Child's flesh that foreshadows the tender putti of the Virgin of the Rocks, are elements that show a distancing from the more distinctive Verrocchiesque style and instead assume those formal and chromatic characteristics that would be the mature Leonardo's very own. Moreover, we should not overlook the striking similarities - in facial features and other details - with the Benois Madonna already mentioned (the gem fastening the Virgin's gown over her breast) and with the Uffizi Annunciation, works that in their figurative and expressive invention quite clearly reveal the stamp of Leonardo"	LEONARDO da Vinci	The Madonna of the Carnation	Oil on panel, 62 x 47,5 cm	1478-80	religious	Italian	1451-1500

Giuseppe developed his bravura style in still-lifes of fish, later he turned increasingly to the decorative Baroque flower piece.This monumental still-life, placed in a landscape with rich vegetation, is a late work of the artist.

33028-06forna.jpg	"Much of Raphael's energy during his last years was directed toward public activity, or at least toward commissioners who were influential in city life and life within the Papal States (he designed a villa, known as the Villa Madama, for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici). Furthermore, many critics attribute to him a series of compositions of the Holy Family and of Saints which were then executed by his followers. The famous portrait of a young woman, called La Fornarina, must also be viewed in this perspective, although it is signed, in Latin, ""Raphael from Urbino"". The signature is engraved on the thin ribbon that the girl wears just under her left shoulder. Tradition identifies her with Margherita Luti, a Sienese woman whom Raphael loved, the daughter of a baker from the Roman district of Santa Dorotea. The stiffness of her features and the heavy chiaroscuro effect make La Fornarina an almost certain workshop piece with the contribution of Raphael, for Raphael's own work from this period is far more delicate.There are several old copies of this painting, the most famous in the Galleria Borghese"	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	Portrait of a Young Woman (La Fornarina)	Oil on wood, 85 x 60 cm	1518-19	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

37129-60portra.jpg	Very few portraits survive from Signorelli's hand. Indubitably his finest is the Portrait of an Elderly Man, probably of a humanist. It is often said to be of a jurist, that profession and humanism considered practically inseparable. Victories before a temple approach athletes in front of a triumphal arch, these all'antica themes pertinent to the sitter's scholarly calling or pretensions. The action taking place in the background may be on his mind, as suggested by his downcast eyes. The hard-won balance between hat, head, V-shaped scarf, and the far-smaller figures is among the major triumphs of his great portrait	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Portrait of an Elderly Man	Poplar, 50 x 32 cm	c. 1492	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
42339-the_hut.jpg	Unlike his elder brother Willem and their father Willem van de Velde the Elder, both famous marine artists, Adriaen chose to landscapes, which he did at least as well as his father and brother did in their genre. He was also a magnificent painter of figures and animals which he included in his compositions in a carefully balanced way.Adriaen van de Velde made many preliminary studies, generally in red or black chalk, of cows oxen, sheep and landscapes going out into the countryside.

18234-0504grec.jpg	Painted for the attic of the High Altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, Toledo, to go above the Assumption. Probably painted 1577-78, following the Assumption. It was El Greco's first commission upon his arrival in Toleedo in 1577. It gained great fame in Toledo, which was artistically rather archaic and provincial, and established a successful career for El Greco in the town.Here the reference is to Rome, rather than to Venice, and specifically to Michelangelo, developing the motif of the Piet&#224;. The general scheme of the composition of the Trinity, however, refers to Dürer's engraving of the same subject. The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. Form is more in evidence here than in the Assumption, especially in the Michelangelesque motif of the naked Christ (for which the artist probably drew inspiration from Michelangelo's  Piet&#224; for Vittoria Colonna), and it is only later that he treats his figures with the same freedom as draperies. Here the suggestion of weight in the supported Dead Christ is appropriate. The stress on the dead body of Christ, together with the clamorous mannerist colors and the rather loose composition of the figures, produces a feverish pathos.El Greco was not to repeat this subject	GRECO, El	The Trinity	Oil on canvas, 300 x 179 cm	1577	religious	Spanish	1551-1600

34278-3bathshe.jpg	Attended by four maids and on the far right, a boy with a mirror, Uriah's beautiful wife, Bathsheba, devotes herself to her elaborate toilette in an enclosed garden. The sight of Bathsheba inflamed King David's desire, and he is usually depicted in a palace-window in the background. Here, however, a maid approaches on the far left with a letter from the king.The painting dates from about 1725 and thus belongs to the artist's late period: its refinement of form and colour is reminiscent of the golden age of Venetian painting in the 16th century, in particular of Veronese. One of the most influential painters of his time, Ricci was well on the road to international success by the turn of the 17th century. His career took him to Parma, Bologna, Rome, Milan, Florence, Venice and London.

40944-11medusa.jpg	From an early point, museums endeavoured to add the name of Leonardo to their collections. As early as 1782 this panel in the museum's depository was linked to a head of Medusa by Leonardo da Vinci which Vasari mentions. It is likely, though, that a well-read Netherlandish artist had read the biographer's description of the monster that is said to have frightened Leonardo's father, and amalgamated it and an independent head of Medusa to produce this painting	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Head of Medusa	Oil on panel, 49 x 74 cm	16th century	other	Flemish	1551-1600

38600-kermis.jpg	Depictions of the 'kermis' or rural fair belong to an iconographic and compositional tradition founded in the Netherlands in about 1550 by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. So when David Teniers painted his first country fair in i637, his native town of Antwerp could already look back on an almost century-long tradition in this genre.The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn shown here demonstrates how Teniers had grown away from Adriaen Brouwer and developed his own style, distinguished primarily by a lighter overall tone and warmer, more radiant colours. The scale of his figures is somewhat reduced in his village scenes, so that they fit more convincingly into his broad, expansive landscapes with their subtly shaded atmospheres. The festivities are being held here in a square, bounded on two sides by a wooden fence, in front of a village tavern similar to that in many other Flemish kermis paintings. A path leads off to the left in the direction of Antwerp Cathedral, which gives the rural festivities a local and municipal frame of reference. The sky, with its vivid stretches of cloud and the gold-tinged light of the evening on the left, is given a special weight, which lends the scene a cool, airy atmosphere and a festive mood.The joyful, lively antics of the farmers are not based on Teniers's own observations, but are pieced together from the handed-down repertoire of motifs for this genre, which were constantly varied and modified. They include the musicians standing on their podium, the three couples doing a round dance in the foreground, the drunk who is being helped home by two farmers, and the man who is leaning by the fence in an attack of nausea. At the end of the canvas on the right edge we also see the motif of the 'unequal couple': Teniers had already used lecherous old farmers hugging young girls as a single motif for a painting	TENIERS, David the Younger	The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn	Oil on canvas, 93 x 132 cm	1641	genre	Flemish	1651-1700
19142-37malle.jpg	"The name ""Malle Babbe van Haarlem"", which could be translated as Silly Betty or Mad Meg of Haarlem, is inscribed on an old piece of stretcher let into the modern one supporting the canvas in Berlin. In 1653, the Haarlem burgomasters allowed the local ""Workhouse"" (which was both a house of correction and a charitable institution) 65 guilders to care for Malle Babbe. The document also refers to Frans Hals mentally impaired son, Pieter, who had been confined in the same place since 1642. Thus a real person served as the model for Hals's painting in Berlin and for a number of related works. The owl was a common symbol of folly in the Netherlands, despite its classical association with Minerva, goddess of wisdom.This picture shows Hals supreme mastery of one of the principal preoccupations of Baroque artists: the rendering of instantaneous emotion and movement. No seventeenth-century artist surpassed Hals in this fields. Hals's vigorous concentration on this was more than an ordinary rendering of reality. He selected moments when human nature reveals all its vital energy. Most frequently he shows the instant when the joy of life is at its highest: the spontaneous laughter of a child, the smile of a courtesan, or the wild shriek of an old crone, like in this painting"	HALS, Frans	Malle Babbe	Oil on canvas, 75 x 64 cm	1633-35	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

23361-01lucret.jpg	"According to Roman legend, Lucretia, who was the wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, was raped by the son of the Roman king - a dishonour which subsequently resulted in her suicide. The event is supposed to have precipitated the collapse of the Etruscan royal line (510 BC) and thus to have led to the founding of the Roman Republic.In the 16th and 17th century Lucretia was frequently portrayed as a symbol of purity. Lotto presents us with the three-quarter view of a woman dressed in fine, richly trimmed clothes. Turned slightly away from the viewer, in her left hand she holds a drawing of the naked Lucretia about to stab herself in the heart. An inscription in Latin on the sheet on the table reads: ""Following Lucretia's example, no dishonoured woman should continue to live"".In the exquisiteness of its palette, the painting ranks amongst Lotto's greatest works. While the subject's face follows on from the tradition of Giorgione, the contrast between her brightly lit shoulders and the richly gradated reds and greens of her dress is worthy of a Titian. The costly pendant suspended from the gold chain, its precious stones refracting the light, is virtually without equal in 16th-century Venetian painting"	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Portrait of a Lady as Lucretia	Oil on canvas, 96 x 111 cm	1530-32	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
03195-aeneas.jpg	Federico Barrocci's Aeneas' Flight from Troy with Anchises, his son Ascanius and his wife Creusa is the second version painted in 1598 of a picture executed ten years earlier for Emperor Rudolf II of Austria. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere presented Cardinal Scipione with this second version, which entered the Borghese collection before 1613. It was this painting that inspired Cardinal Scipione to commission a large marble group on the same subject from Gian Lorenzo Bernini (also in the Borghese Gallery). The myth of Aeneas, ancestor of Romulus and Remus, referred to the birth of Rome and thus confirmed the Borghese family's high status in the city.Barrocci's many drawings of nature led him to achieve a spontaneity and naturalness in movement, colour and airy effects, and a silvery luminosity that was to influence the 17th-century masters, particularly Rubens. Never before had flames been painted so close to, with an energy suggesting even the crackle of the fire, from which Ascanius seems to be protecting himself by covering his ears. But the human delicacy of Barrocci's anti-heroic and anti-rhetorical figures was not to be really appreciated in Rome, because it could not compete with the classical antique statuary	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Aeneas' Flight from Troy	Oil on canvas, 179 x 253 cm	1598	mythological	Italian	1551-1600

06485-01weddin.jpg	Painted about 1567, this picture has traditionally been thought of simply as a depiction of peasant life. However, it seems likely that, in addition to the obvious celebration of peasant life, the picture has a moral dimension - the celebration of the sacrament of marriage has simply become an excuse for self-indulgence. Whereas in his earlier engraved work Bruegel represented the Vices as elaborate allegories peopled by Boschian monsters, here human weakness is commented on in an understated, naturalistic and humorous manner.The wedding feast is dominated by the figure of the bride who, radiant and composed, presides over the table beneath a canopy. Less obvious is the identity of the bridegroom; he may be the man in black, with his back to the spectator, leaning back on his stool, mug in hand, calling for more wine. The feast is taking place in the barn, the wall behind the guests consisting of stacked-up straw or corn. Two ears of corn with a rake call to the mind work that harvesting involves. The plates are being carried around on a door taken off its hinges. The principal form of nourishment in those day consisted of bread, porridge and soup.A curious detail of the scene which has never been satisfactorily explained is the presence on the far right of a richly-dressed nobleman in earnest conversation with a monk. The monk has presumably just conducted the service of marriage and it has been suggested that he is tediously reminiscing about previous weddings he has attended to the local landowner.

His right hand is placed on his hip, in an attitude setting off the heavy folds of a red cloak.Democritus, who lived around 470-360 BC, taught that cheerful and moderate contentment was the way to happiness.

03914-207feas.jpg	"The Feast of the Gods was Giovanni Bellini's last great  painting and one of only a few that he executed on canvas. It was the first in a series of mythologies or bacchanals commissioned by Duke Alfonso d'Este to decorate the camerino d'alabastro, or alabaster study, of his castle in Ferrara. The artist, whose career began in the 1450s, was trained to paint on wooden panels, which require a very meticulous application of pigment. When he worked on canvas late in his career, Bellini retained his tight, precise brushwork. The flesh tones, iridescent silks, and even the foreground pebbles here demonstrate his delicate touch.According to the current interpretations, the scene illustrates a passage from Ovid's Fasti (The Feasts), a long classical poem that recounts the origins of many  ancient Roman rites and festivals. Ovid (43 B.C. - A.D. 17), describing a banquet given by the god of wine, mentioned an incident that embarrassed Priapus, god of  virility.The beautiful nymph Lotis, shown reclining at the far right, was lulled to sleep by wine. Priapus, overcome by lust, seized the opportunity to take advantage of her and is portrayed bending forward to lift her skirt. His attempt was foiled when an ass, seen at the left, ""with raucous braying, gave out an ill-timed roar. Awakened, the startled nymph pushed Priapus away, and the god was laughed at by all."" Priapus, his pride wounded, took revenge by demanding the annual sacrifice of a donkey.The ass stands next to Silenus, a woodland deity who used the beast to carry wood, thus wears a keg on his belt because he was a follower of Bacchus, god of wine. Bacchus himself, seen as an infant, kneels before them while decanting wine into a crystal pitcher.Reading from left to right, the principal figures are:Silenus, a woodland god attended by his donkeyBacchus, the infant god of wine crowned with grape leavesFaunus or Silvanus, an old forest god wearing a wreath of pine needlesMercury, the messenger of the gods carrying his caduceus or herald's staffJupiter, the king of the gods accompanied by an eagleAn unidentified goddess holding a quince, a fruit associated in the ancient world with marriagePan, a satyr with a grape wreath who blows on his shepherd's pipesNeptune, the god of the sea sitting beside his trident harpoonCeres, the goddess of cereal grains with a wreath of wheatApollo, god of the sun and the arts, crowned by laurel and holding a Renaissance stringed musical instrument, the lira da braccio, in lieu of a classical lyrePriapus, the god of virility and of vineyards with a scythe, used to prune orchards, hanging from the tree above himLotis, one of the naiads, a nymph of fresh waters who represents chastity.These deities are waited upon by three naiads, nymphs of streams and brooks, and two satyrs, goat-footed inhabitants of the wilderness.

24177-clement9.jpg	Apart from demonstrating the favours granted by important Roman patrons, Maratti's portraits are also perhaps the most lively and penetrating part of his work. He took pains to capture the exact physiognomy of his sitters in whom he sometimes seemed to uncover an incurable feeling of melancholy hiding just below the surface. Here his admiration for Raphael's portraits is evident, but he has added a more stylish air to suit the tastes of the high Baroque.The painting was executed shortly before the death of the Pope who was on the throne from 1667 to 1669. It is signed on the paper sheet on the table	MARATTI, Carlo	Portrait of Pope Clement IX	Oil on canvas, 158 x 119 cm	1669	portrait	Italian	1651-1700
15755-tobias_a.jpg	The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight	GIAQUINTO, Corrado	Tobias and the Angel	Oil on canvas, 58 x 48 cm	c. 1740	religious	Italian	1701-1750
11538-laidtabl.jpg	The aesthetically conservative principle of tables arranged strictly parallel to the horizontal edges of the painting was followed by Nicolaes Gillis and Floris Claesz van Dijck. (Predecessors were probably family paintings such as Marten van Heemskerck's.) Their still-lifes are classified as 'ontbijtjes' (breakfast still-lifes). Onbijt(je) was a light meal which could be taken at any time of the day. Strictly speaking, most of the paintings by Gillis and van Dijck are dessert still-lifes, developed at roughly the time by Osias Beert and Clara Peeters.All these artists show a table with a table runner and a carefully ironed, white damask tablecloth whose creases, regardless of the laws of perspective, run in parallel lines towards the back of the painting. A relatively high viewpoint was also chosen, apparently to afford a good overall survey of the objects, which are arranged side by side, or in a circle, hardly ever touching or overlapping. The precious drinking vessels and pieces of textile show very clearly that the arrangement is that of a privileged household.In accordance with etiquette, fruit, pies, nuts and confectionery were served as a dessert. Cheese, which had a central role in Gillis's and van Dijck's art, was also part of the dessert. Gillis and van Dijck build up pyramids of hard cheese in two or three layers: at the bottom there is half a large cheese with a rich, yellow hue, indicating that it is still very young, while on the top the cheeses are smaller and more brownish, almost grey in colour, showing that they are older and more mature. The irregular traces of cuts with a knife - the only piece of cutlery on the table - are rendered extremely well	DIJCK, Floris Claesz van	Laid Table	Oil on wood, 100 x 135 cm	1622	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
34260-bacchan2.jpg	The pair of canvases, depicting The Bacchanal in Honour of Pan and The Feast of Silenus, were commissioned by the celebrated patron of the arts, Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg (1661-1747). A German aristocrat and general of the Saxon and Venetian armies, Schulenburg settled in Venice upon his retirement where he began to amass a spectacular collection, acquiring paintings by the likes of Raphael, Giorgione and Correggio. In addition to the present canvases, Ricci painted two further versions of these pendants	RICCI, Sebastiano	Feast of Silenus	Oil on canvas, 99 x 114 cm	-	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
17035-flower08.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 213, JH 1247.Van Gogh arrived in Paris in March 1886. Although he was able to see a considerable amount of contemporary French painting by the Impressionists and their followers - Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte was exhibited twice in 1886 - he took little notice for at least a year. As a letter written to an English artist he had met in Antwerp reveals, he continued with what he had been doing in Antwerp. He enrolled again in an atelier, where he could draw and paint the nude from plaster casts and live models.Since he could ill afford to hire models, he painted large numbers of still-lifes of flowers in order to study the colour theory of Hals and Delacroix. He wrote that he was 'trying to render intense colour and not a grey harmony'. The present painting indicates to what extent he had accomplished this aim. It also demonstrates the now varied ways in which he applied his paint: dashes in the background to break up the blue field of the wall, directional brushstrokes on the table, impasto highlights on the metal vase. The plant itself is virtually drawn in colour; each leaf is a separate stroke and the heads of the flowers are depicted with more voluptuous and solid sweeps of paint	GOGH, Vincent van	Fritillaries in a Copper Vase	Oil on canvas, 74 x 61 cm	April-May 1887, Paris	still-life	Dutch	1851-1900

06439-12july.jpg	Neither the signature nor the date have survived on this panel, but it clearly belongs to the series of the Months, all the other panels of which are dated 1565. July and August are the months of the harvest, and this painting and the August panel (The Corn Harvest) show the bringing-in of the harvest. It is not just the grain that is being harvested but, as can be seen in the foreground, vegetables and berries as well. While each painting in the series shows the traditional occupation of that month, Bruegel's real subject is the landscape itself, its ever-changing appearance. There is a profound sense in which human activity is at best peripheral to the life of the landscape itself. Bruegel is concerned to show that the seasonal concerns of men are dictated by the land	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Haymaking (July)	Oil on panel, 117 x 161 cm	1565	landscape	Netherlandish	1501-1550

For this reason the canvas was replaced by a new version on slate. This was quite different from the first painting; its composition was divided over three separate panels.

On December 26th of that year the work must have been already completed since payment for it is recorded on this date. Vasari gave a detailed description of the work which was the basis for art critics for the attempt at reconstruction and for the recovery and identification of the work which was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century. Only eleven pieces have so far come to light and they are not sufficient to enable a reliable reconstruction of the whole work. The Crucifixion is one of the eleven panels (one of the top panels) connected with the Pisa Polyptych.As in the main panel, the Gothic arch determines the pictorial frame, the upward stress of which Masaccio modifies in his composition. To counter the vertical trust imposed by the arch, Masaccio creates a strong horizontal effect with the rather exaggerated extension of the arms of Christ on the cross. Although Masaccio still uses the gilt background for his representation, the atmospheric effects remain hauntingly convincing.

37004-service.jpg	The Grote Kerk in Weesp was originally a Catholic church consecrated to St Lawrence, in 1582 it became Protestant and its name was changed from Laurentiuskerk to Grote Kerk.For Dutch architectural painters the people in the church served as staffage to enliven the stone setting. This is different with Sibilla: for him the architecture is not central, but rather the depicted persons, who are very large in relation to the building. About seventy can be counted, a few of whom seem to be portraits. Certain elements, such as the dogs, bring a genre scene to mind. The combination of a church interior, group portrait, and genre scene is unique in Sibilla's oeuvre	SIBILLA, Gijsbert Jansz.

10194-adamev05.jpg	To the rigorous, perfectly Renaissance Dürer, troubled by the question of the proportions of the human body, Cranach, in his nudes, responds by freeing himself from every rule and from any observation of anatomical accuracy. His figures are elongated out of all proportion, seem boneless and are shown in affected, theatrical poses. The naked bodies, ivory-coloured against a dark background, emanate a totally cold, intellectual eroticism. The effect is accentuated in this work, for example, by the malicious gesture with which Eve holds out the apple, with her other hand bent unnaturally to hold the frond which covers her loins, but above all by the sly expression on her slightly cruel face.Attributed once to Albrecht Dürer, the work is documented in Florentine Medicean collections yet in 1688	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Adam and Eve	Oil on wood, 172 x 63 cm and 167 x 61 cm	1528	religious	German	1501-1550
21646-rinaldo1.jpg	The subject was inspired by the 16th-century epic poem 'Gerusalemme Liberata' (Jerusalem Delivered) by Torquato Tasso (1544-1595). Rinaldo and Armida are a pair of lovers in the poem which is an idealized account of the first Crusade which ended with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the establishment of a Christian kingdom. Armida, a beautiful virgin witch, had been sent by Satan (whose aid the Saracens had enlisted0 to bring about the Crusaders' undoing by sorcery. She sought revenge on the Christian prince Rinaldo after he had rescued his companions whom she had changed into monsters. The pastoral story of hate turned of love, of the lovers' dalliance in Armida's magic kingdom, and Rinaldo's final desertion of her, forms a sequence of themes that were widely popular with Italian and French artists in the 17th and 18th centuries.

25100-2sebasti.jpg	St Sebastian is standing frontally with his hands over his head tied to a tree in a tree-filled landscape with abundant vegetation in the foreground. The towers of a castle loom up in the background. Apart from his loincloth he is naked. Both sides of his body are pierced with arrows. The handling of light is full of contrast, with ample use of white lead on the rosy skin standing out against the very dark green of the surroundings.Various characteristics in the manner of painting and the style, as well as the conception, enable us to ascribe this hitherto unknown panel to the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. The stiff, marionette-like figures with heavily drawn features; the hard, richly contrasted palette; and the systematic use in his landscapes of stereotypical vegetation and towers or city views in the distance are typical of nearly all his compositions.In this St Sebastian all these elements are clearly visible. The physiognomy with the heavy nose and the rather oriental eyes with large, vaulted upper eyelids and bushy eyebrows is to be seen in several of his works, for example, the Lamentation in Minneapolis and in the Tallinn altarpiece. The flat folds of the loincloth can be compared with the Virgin's head-scarf in the Lamentation of the Thyssen Foundation, where Christ's torso has been modelled in much the same way. The manner in which the vegetation is treated is almost identical in the St John on Patmos of Rotterdam and in the Legend of St Lucy in St James' Church in Bruges.Owing to its small format, it can be suspected that the St Sebastian was the wing of a triptych. The painting on the reverse was probably planed away when the cradle was applied	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Lucy	St Sebastian	Oil on oak panel, 70 x 27 cm	1480-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
05199-11magici.jpg	The Magician belonging to Bosch's early paintings is now lost but it is known through a faithful copy at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. A mountebank has set up his table before a crumbling stone wall. His audience watches spellbound as he seems to bring forth a frog from the mouth of an old man in their midst; only one of the crowd, the young man with his hand on the shoulder of his female companion, appears to notice that the old man's purse is being stolen by the conjuror's confederate. The myopic gaze of the thief and the stupid amazement of the frog-spitting victim are superbly played off against the amused reactions of the bystanders, while the slyness of the mountebank is well conveyed in his sharp-nosed physiognomy. Bosch exploits the human face in profile for expressive purposes. Although the painting may possess a moralizing significance, it must have been inspired by a real-life situation closely observed. The perceptive, spontaneous humour of this little picture would be difficult to match in contemporary Flemish painting, but parallels can be found among Dutch manuscript illuminators	BOSCH, Hieronymus	The Magician	Oil on panel, 53 x 75 cm	1475-80	genre	Netherlandish	1451-1500

07957-farnes01.jpg	In 1597 Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Annibale Carracci's great masterpiece, the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese in the Palazzo Farnese, the most splendid and influential ceiling decoration in Rome since that of the Sistine Chapel. Annibale's brother Agostino assisted him on at least two of the scenes until they quarrelled and Agostino left Rome. In contrast to the earlier interpretation which saw them as a Neoplatonic allegory of the victory of Celestial Love over physical passion, in recent years Annibale's frescoes have generally been regarded as a witty and joyous celebration of the classical gods in love.During the 1570s and 1580s fresco cycles with mythological subjects had been relatively unfashionable in Rome, since the climate of the Counter Reformation favoured religious decoration, even in secular buildings such as palaces and villas. It may be a measure of the Catholic Church's confidence in winning the battle for souls that it could increasingly tolerate such overtly erotic decoration, even in a cardinal's palace, albeit in what was probably one of the more private rooms. Besides celebrating love's power to conquer, it is likely that the frescoes were intended to complement the antique statues, some of the finest in one of Rome's most magnificent collection of antiquities, which were displayed there	CARRACCI, Annibale	The Galleria Farnese	Fresco	1597-1602	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
37208-maesta_2.jpg	After a few years of Duccio's Maest&#224;, Simone painted his Maest&#224; for the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, as the ideal of the good and just government. This is the oldest painting that can be safely attributed to him. The end wall of the Sala del Mappamondo is entirely covered by this fresco. Surrounded by a frame decorated with twenty medallions depicting the Blessing Christ, the Prophets and the Evangelists and with smaller shields containing the coat-of-arms of Siena, the fresco shows a host of angels, Saints and Apostles, with the Madonna and Child in the centre. The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk.The most obvious innovations present in Simone's style are his ideas of three-dimensional space. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition. Under the canopy there is a crowd of thirty people: no more processions of people in parallel rows, but concrete spacial rhythms and animated gestures	SIMONE MARTINI	Maest?

00123-marketse.jpg	The painting is an Ecce Homo fragment. Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Scene	Oil on oak, 59,5 x 122,5 cm	c. 1550	still-life	Netherlandish	1501-1550

19512-luke_pai.jpg	Due to the fame of Rogier van der Weyden's St Luke Painting the Virgin, dozens of artists painted this subject over the next century, especially in the Low Countries and Germany. The composition and its content evolved over time as attitudes about art changed. Van Heemskerk created his version possibly as an altarpiece for Delft's St Luke's guild. The apparent influence of Michelangelo and the inclusion of antique sculptures indicates the stay of the artist in Rome. The painting harks back to Jan Gossart's St Luke Painting the Virgin in Prague, but now the background reflects his visits to courtyards in Rome that were full of recently unearthed antiquities	HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van	St Luke Painting the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 206 x 144 cm	1550-53	religious	Dutch	1501-1550
12980-grimaldi.jpg	The Genoese noblewoman is shown on the terrace of her palace. The soaring columns and cloud-swept sky add a sense of height and dignity to the majestic figure, while the brilliant red parasol relieves the otherwise somber colour scheme. The Genoese nobility, wealthy from the trade of its powerful merchant marine, had many ties with members of the Spanish court and adopted many customs from them, including the sumptuous but sober fabrics of courtly dress. Van Dyck, in these portraits of his Genoese period, has immortalized the dignity and splendid scale of living of his patrons	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Marchesa Elena Grimaldi Cattaneo	Oil on canvas, 243 x 139 cm	c. 1623	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

Cranach's painting is based on van Orley, his source was, however, not one of the official portraits but a chalk drawing now in Berlin.The painter depicts the sitter in a white hood in the Netherlandish style. The Governess of the Netherlands had adopted this form of dress in a modest acknowledgement of her widowhood	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Portrait of Margaret of Austria	Oil and tempera on red beechwood, 50 x 35 cm	1520s	portrait	German	1501-1550
40998-08virdol.jpg	"On grounds of the inscription on the cover of the twelve panels that had originally been fastened together to form a book, the picture is considered to be the work of a painter called ""Jaques Daliwe"", who probably had immigrated to France from the Low Countries and then worked beside the Limbourg brothers in the court of the Duc de Berry. (Though the name ""Daliwe"" could be also a reference to the proprietor.) The artist may have used the booklet as a note-book for about twenty years. In it he put down his memories, ideas and everything he saw and considered interesting while moving from one place to another. Often, as was the case with the drawing reproduced here, he composed homogeneous scenes from the different motifs in his individual manner.As a rule the seated lamenting figures of the Virgin and St John are represented below the crucified Christ. But here both Christ and the cross have been removed and only the two of them remain in the place of the Crucifixion. In front of them there are scattered the instruments of torture, whereas behind them - as though it were their common thought - the figure of the suffering Christ is to be seen surrounded by a cloud of angels. His face is distorted by pain, His head is bowed forwards and His crossed arms have slipped slightly sideways in the sarcophagus. The imagination of His mother and His favourite disciple have enlarged His figure into monumental dimensions, but the two react to the scene in different ways: the Virgin is leaning her face onto her hand and is engrossed in her thoughts; wrapped in her cloak, she stares into space. St John is more agitated and active, and raises his head passionately.The difference between the vision and the real scene is shown not only in the scale of the figures but also in the technique of drawing. The Virgin, St John and the ground are modelled with the most delicate tints of grey, while the paler figure of Christ is interpreted by more linear means, first of all with contours, whereas the host of angels is conveyed only by gossamer fine outlines. The drawing may have been a preparatory sketch to a painting, its composition being based on a strictly geometrical framework. The central axis of the picture is indicated by two nails lying in the foreground and meeting at their tips. If we, in our imagination, lengthen their lines up to the top corners we get two smaller triangles on the two sides and a larger one in the middle of the top. The former include the figures of the Virgin and of St John respectively, whereas the latter frames Christ's figure with the angels, whose whirling movements fill up the triangle standing on its point"	UNKNOWN MASTER, French	Vir Dolorum (Man of Sorrows)	Lead and tempera on wood, 8,7 x 12,6 cm	1400-20	religious	French	1401-1450

Lippi shows the figures caught in a diagonal shaft of light that falls across the back of the angel and illuminates the Virgin by passing through an open door notionally located behind a pilaster with engaged columns. The bilateral division of the Annunciation by a prominent architectural feature is a hallmark of Lippi's early work	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	The Annunciation	Tempera on panel, 100 x 161 cm	1435-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450
41312-01madonn.jpg	"Originally venerated in the convent church of Santa Maria in Campo Marzio (Rome) this painting is an icon: its miraculous powers are attested by Bombelli, in his 1792 engraving of the panel. Iconographically, the image is connected to the Constantinopolitan ""Haghiosoritissa"", a type of image in which the Virgin is represented in the act of interceding with Christ on behalf of the human race. The proposed dating of the painting to the middle of the twelfth century is generally accepted on the basis of stylistic similarities to a panel of the Last Judgment in the Pinacoteca of the Vatican Museums.Stylistically different from other Roman panels that depict the same subject, the painting has been assigned to the same hand that executed the Blessing Christ (Vatican Museums, Pinacoteca), a picture that also originally decorated Santa Maria in Campo Marzio. The two works are characterized by an accentuated linearism typical of Byzantine style and a monumental quality that is distinctly Roman. They show identical treatments of chiaroscuro effects, simplified folds of the drapery, and effects light. Also shared by the two paintings are the brown intonations in the face, which give little concession to colorism, and certain signature characteristics like the rapid brushwork with which the artist defines the folds of Christ's neck or the dark triangle that divides the eyebrows of the Virgin.The inscription at the bottom: ""SCA VIRGO VIRGINUM"""	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	The Madonna as Advocate (Haghiosoritissa)	Tempera on panel covered with canvas, 107 x 58 cm	1150s	religious	Italian	1151-1200

Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife. However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned. It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses	HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder	Portrait of a Man	Oil on panel, 24 x 17 cm	1518-20	portrait	German	1451-1500

It is probably by a copyist.The bearded sitter in this portrait rests his arms on a stone parapet and holds a rosary with a pomander attached.

14319-mad_sai.jpg	The popularity of Francia's paintings arises from their very individual expression of harmony, both in content and form.  This is evoked by his simple arrangements of figures, usually parallel with the picture surface in the immediate foreground and the tender, almost sentimental expression of his Madonnas and saints.

00960-03prede3.jpg	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes	ANGELICO, Fra	The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in Heaven	Tempera and gold on panel, 26 x 53 cm	1434-35	religious	Italian	1401-1450

40733-01icon.jpg	The centre of the high altar in the Santa Maria della Salute holds the icon of the Madonna of Health, installed here in November 1670. It came from Candia cathedral where it was known as the San Tito Madonna or Mesopanditissa (after the day on which it was celebrated, between Christmas and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). Doge Morosini brought it to Venice as a trophy after peace had been made with the Turks at the end of the Candia war. Tradition has it that the artist was St Luke the Evangelist and that it is consequently a miraculous sacred image, but it was actually the work of a 12th century Madonna painter.

26346-composin.jpg	The emphasis on gentility and opulence intensified in Metsu's works during the final years  of his career as did his painstaking technique which became harder and drier. Such works as the Young Woman Composing Music present a rarefied view of the leisure life of moneyed urbanites. In this panel, a woman gazes serenely as if lost in thought as she composes music, poised to record the notes played by her lute-strumming confidant behind the table. A man, perhaps an admirer, peers over her shoulder as she works. The room is extravagantly decorated from its wooden table bedecked with an expensive Turkish carpet to the eye-catching mantelpiece that mimics a real one in the Amsterdam Town Hall.

07410-pepoli2.jpg	From a young age, the painter enjoyed the protection of the Pepoli family. Count Odoardo Pepoli commissioned Canuti to paint two long oval ceiling pictures in the stairwell of the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande. They illustrated significant events from the life of Taddeo Pepoli. Canuti here shows himself to have been a close student of Veronese, from whom, in addition to the oval shape and certain compositional elements, he adopted the extreme view from below	CANUTI, Domenico Maria	Taddeo Pepoli Installed as Apostolic Vicar by Pope Benedict XII	Fresco	1655	mythological	Italian	1651-1700
25926-cremona1.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the façade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the façade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515. Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative. The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.Melone continued the cycle on the right wall, he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists	MELONE, Altobello	Flight to Egypt	Fresco	1517	religious	Italian	1501-1550
22214-lot_daug.jpg	"The story of the destruction of Sodom, Lot's escape, and his subsequent seduction by his two daughters is told in Genesis. Lot and his family were allowed to leave the city on condition that they did not look back. Lot's wife disobeyed the instruction and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot continued on with his daughters. Since their husbands had not fled with them, the daughters said to each other: ""Our father is old and there is not a man in the country to come to us in the usual way. Come now, let us make our father drink wine and then lie with him and in this way keep the family alive through our father."" The sons born of this union subsequently founded the tribes of the Moabites and the Ammonites.Both as a strongly erotic group painting and as a history painting, the subject was a popular one in the 16th and 17th century. This painting, whose attribution to van Leyden - said to have executed his first commission at the age of twelve - is not altogether certain, falls into the second category. Alongside the group in the foreground, the destruction of Sodom seen in the left-hand background establishes a second point of focus. Influenced by Patenier, the painter portrays a kind of ""global landscape"" extending from the front left-hand corner into the depths of the composition. He thereby devotes particular care to the execution of the landscape details"	LEYDEN, Lucas van	Lot and his Daughters	Oil on wood, 48 x 34 cm	c. 1520	religious	Netherlandish	1501-1550

12020-witchcra.jpg	The official painter of the Este court, Dossi painted the family portraits, filled castles with paintings and frescoed villas. This routine, which for other painters might have seemed mortifying, did nothing to extinguish the vivacious and brilliant vein of the artist. Dossi is always consistent. He flushes the flesh tones of his characters with orangy, reddish colours, he places them in risqué situations, with bare-chested women in convivial surroundings and almost obscene merrymaking men with such highly characterized faces that they are almost caricatures. The faces of the women and that of the faun are drawn directly from a cultured classical tradition which is inserted into the Mannerist context. The other characters, emerging from a humid, obscure background, are anything but stereotypes: healthy faces reddened by feasting, grimaces, a variety of attitudes. The only note of light - quite unreal - which stands out from the prevalently ruddy tones, falls directly onto the breasts of the woman holding a bowl of fruit	DOSSI, Dosso	Witchcraft (Allegory of Hercules)	Oil on canvas, 143 x 144 cm	1540-42	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

40185-allegory.jpg	In his large-scale pictures, De Troy tends to lose vivacity of touch, replacing it by a rather heavy handling which can yet be effective, though it probably accounted partly for the unenthusiastic reception his actual cartoons, for example, had in Paris. His imagination was rather heavy, too. The result could be a curious blend of the prosaic and the painterly, as instanced in the Allegory of Time unveiling Truth. There is something ludicrous about Time's would-be flying figure, suspended so awkwardly and with his legs oddly detached. Altogether, as allegory, the composition remains prosaically earthbound	TROY, Jean-François de	An Allegory of Time Unveiling Truth	Oil on canvas	1733	mythological	French	1701-1750

07186-canal303.jpg	The compositions of this work and its companion picture (The Molo: Looking West, in the same collection) complement each other very effectively; they both show dominant buildings in the foreground to one side of the picture, from which the eye meanders both across the painting and into the distance. Their subjects are also complementary; they depict views of the waterfront on either side of the Molo, the seaward part of the Piazzetta. In this painting the view extends from the Doge's Palace right along the quay known as the Riva degli Schiavoni. Boats of all sizes throng the water, and Venetians are shown either in the lofty pursuit of trade and politics (a group of officials energe from the Doge's Palace), or the equally fascinating, although more down to earth business of begging and gossiping. The other painting shows the view from the Column of San Teodoro over towards Santa Maria della Salute on the far side of the Grand Canal.These subjects became extremely popular and were rethought by Canaletto and his studio with small variations for a number of other clients. Canaletto executed related drawings which both he and his assistants could use as a guide when plotting these views	CANALETTO	Riva degli Schiavoni: Looking East	Oil on canvas, 58,4 x 101,6 cm	1730	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

19587-stjerome.jpg	Jan Sanders van Hemessen's religious works are dominated by genre elements. His work therefore represents a significant step in the development of genre painting in its own right. St. Jerome, which originally hung in Rockox's house, is an early work and not entirely typical. In it, he does move away from the traditional rules which artists followed meekly enough in the previous century, and appears to be searching for some kind of originality through exaggeration and ostentation, both in the external appearance of the figure he depicts, and in the emotions he sought to convey	HEMESSEN, Jan Sanders van	St Jerome	Oil on panel, 103 x 81 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
08439-pillow.jpg	"The painting depicts a group of young women in full length, modestly dressed and seated on simple wicker chairs, who are making pillow lace in a bare room without windows or furnishings. The ""sewing school,"" a widespread theme in genre painting of the period, was most likely developed as such by the Danish artist Bernhard Keil (1624-1687), known as Mons&#249; Bernardo, who was active in northern Italy and who repeatedly treated the subject as an allegory of the senses of touch and sight"	CERUTI, Giacomo	Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School)	Oil on canvas, 150 x 200 cm	1720s	genre	Italian	1701-1750
31008-shepher.jpg	The companion piece depicting a Shepherd Boy is also in the Residenzgalerie in Salzburg.Piazzetta's unusual way of depicting the Peasant Girl and the Shepherd Boy is evidenced first of all by his choice of a transverse oval picture format. Only a partial view of the boy is given, and his face, which is aligned slightly rearwards, is partly covered by a large hat. In his frontal view of the sleeping girl, the artist underlined the intimate, lascivious character of the picture by giving her a low-cut dress.The half-length paintings of the girl and boy are modelled on the half-length figures of Caravaggio. The artist was indebted to Crespi for the genre elements and the down-to-earth realism of the depictions as well as for its traditional rustic character	PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista	Peasant Girl	Oil on canvas, 66 x 83 cm	1720-22	genre	Italian	1701-1750
43135-abraham.jpg	For long time it was thought that the painting represents Jacob and Laban.

09663-1stufa1.jpg	"The picture shows a view of the Stanza della Stufa with the Age of Iron (left) and the Age of Gold and Age of Silver (right).Of the numerous apartments in the Palazzo Pitti, two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.In the winter quarters Pietro da Cortona decorated the Stanza della Stufa, and the Rooms of the Planets (Sala di Venere; Sala di Giove; Sala di Marte; Sala di Apollo) between 1637 and 1661.The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641.

28657-5cathed2.jpg	When Monet began his serial compositions in the late 1880s, which initially featured haystacks, then polars, and in the early 1890s the cathedral at Rouen, these works constituted a logical progression of his artistic interests. By constantly portraying the same subject, the variables determined by the time of the day and the lighting could be particularly strongly accentuated. Different times of day and a changing colour palette were substituted for innovative subject matter. Monet included the time of the day and the dominant colours in the respective titles of his paintings as a matter of course.Sometimes he worked simultaneously on two canvases, in order to be able to react immediately to changing light conditions. As a result, the subject of the picture receded further and further into the background. At first glance we can see the shape of a cathedral, but on closer inspection the cathedral architecture dissolves before our eyes into a vibrant ensemble, composed merely of a collection of brush strokes	MONET, Claude	Rouen Cathedral in Full Sunlight	Oil on canvas, 107 x 73 cm	1893	landscape	French	1851-1900

To the right, behind Old Horse Guards on the far side of Whitehall, is Inigo Jones' Banqueting Hall.

17142-arles64.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 604, JH 1656.This cheerful still-life was painted shortly after van Gogh left the hospital in Arles which he had entered after his first major attack of psychomotor epilepsy on 25 December 1888. The objects depicted have both an allegorical and a more personal significance. The lighted candle, used in the painting of Gauguin's chair, derives from the emblematic tradition of still-life and signifies light and life; its opposite, the snuffed-out candle, was used in memento mori still-life and van Gogh had included it in a still-life with books which he painted after his father's death in 1885 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh). The optimistic note sounded by the candle flame is underlined by the presence of the sprouting onions, taken from his Yellow Chair (a 'self-portrait'). On the other hand, van Gogh has added his pipe and tobacco and an empty bottle, possibly once containing absinthe, all of which endangered his health.Modern research has intriguingly shown that absinthe itself can cause epileptic fits. Van Gogh had consumed this poisonous beverage in some quantity during the months in Arles, and many of his subsequent fits coincide with occasions on which he had access to it. The drawing board on which most of these objects are placed indicates van Gogh's resumption of work. He informed his brother that he was painting still-lifes to ease himself back into painting after his hospitalization. However, the colours used in this painting are more tempered and less intense, more controlled and less arbitrary than those he had been using both in the summer of 1888 and under the aegis of Gauguin in the autumn preceding his attack	GOGH, Vincent van	Still-Life with Drawing Board and Onions	Oil on canvas, 50 x 64 cm	January 1889, Arles	still-life	Dutch	1851-1900

Just to the right of the island appear the Magazzini del Sal, dazzlingly illuminated, the Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute on the spit of land known as the Dorsoduro. The Campanile of San Marco looms right on the vertical axis, counterbalancing the predominant horizontals. On the right, the Riva degli Schiavoni stretches beyond the church of the Pieta.The glassy green surface of the water with the dark bank in the foreground, the contrasting light on the various buildings and the snow-white clouds lend the painting an atmosphere all its own. The boat and the shadows in the foreground are motifs which also occur in works of late seventeenth-century Dutch painters of harbour views such as Abraham and Johannes Storck, who may have served Richter as a source of inspiration.Typical of Richter's work are the boats in the foreground painted horizontal to the picture plane. The present canvas occupies a special position among Richter's identified works. He usually worked in the style of Carlevaris, whom he imitated deceptively well. However, in this picture Canaletto's spacious views of the Lagoon were his principal source of inspiration. The remarkable colour combination &#151; green and black &#151; recalls Canaletto's work of the early 1730s. Richter, who died in 1745, must have painted this view of the Bacino toward the end of his career.

18104-2tosse1.jpg	In the centre of the Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse the Madonna breast feeding the Child is depicted. This type of Madonna was common from the late Middle ages onwards. She is surrounded by St Peter with the keys and a book, St Catherine with a broken wheel, St Margaret with a cross, and St Paul with a sword and book. In order to create the impression of a real altarpiece, several angels are holding a curtain around the altar painting. At the bottom edge of the picture, as if placed there quite by chance, Benozzo has painted a small pointed panel painting showing the face of Christ	GOZZOLI, Benozzo	Maria Lactans	Transferred fresco	1484	religious	Italian	1451-1500
38854-bologna1.jpg	The young Pellegrino Tibaldi, who was one of Daniele da Volterra's assistants in Rome, executed two murals in the newly constructed chapel of Cardinal Giovanni Poggi in San Giacomo, Bologna. The chapel, which is dedicated to John the Baptist, has an elaborate system of architectonic articulation. Tibaldi's frescoes (The Sermon of John the Baptist; Annunciation of the Birth of John the Baptist) are restricted to one large field each on the left and right walls. The frescoes are distinguished by unconventional iconography, learned allegory, and newly invented moments in history, that are at the same time commented on by painted manifestations in the heavens.In the left-hand mural John is baptizing and preaching repentance, while angels in heaven are putting devils into chains	TIBALDI, Pellegrino	The Sermon of John the Baptist	Fresco	1551-53	religious	Italian	1551-1600
11485-portlord.jpg	This painting represents a small full-length portrait of Lord Robert Kerr standing by a tree; a military camp beyond. Lord Robert Kerr was a cornet in Lord Mark Kerr's Regiment of Dragoons where he had been commissioned in 1739.Arthur Devis is the best of the many English 18th-century painters of small-scale intimate portraits and conversation pieces.

31418-004sienb.jpg	The picture shows the view from the window wall of the entry wall with the scenes of the presentation of Frederick III to Eleonora of Portugal and Enea Silvio Piccolomini being elevated to cardinal.The ten compartments are separated by painted pilasters with grotteschi decoration, while each individual scene is framed by illusionistic jambs and arches decorated with simulated red and white marble paneling. Wee seem to be looking through the arches of a gigantic loggia into scenes from Enea Silvio's life. The pageant-like incidents display a panoply of colourful costumes against fanciful architectural or landscape backgrounds, except when a recognizable setting was required by the narrative	PINTURICCHIO	View of the Piccolomini Library	Fresco	1502-08	interior	Italian	1451-1500

43874-haarlem.jpg	For Weissenbruch and other artists of the Hague School, with their knowledge of Dutch 17th-century art and the Barbizon School, plain air painting became fundamental. Taking Daubigny's floating studio as their model, Weissenbruch and Roelofs regularly went out in boats. Weissenbruch's spacious Dutch scenes, such as View of Haarlem, contrast in their use of bolder and broader brushwork. In their own specific lyrical way, drawing foremost on the colourist juxtaposition of silvery blues and greens with warmer shades, Weissenbruch paintings nicely captured the moist atmosphere that lies upon Dutch landscapes	WEISSENBRUCH, Jan Hendrik	View of Haarlem	Oil on canvas, 72 x 102 cm	-	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
14381-lastjudg.jpg	The Last Judgment by Hieronymus Francken II is the companion piece of the Damned Being Cast into Hell by Frans Francken II. Frans II and Hieronymus II were brothers, they were taught by their uncle Hieronymus I at the same time. This explains the similarity of their hand. Both scenes were based on engravings from a cycle by Hendrik Goltzius.In the Last Judgment most of the figures were taken from Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican	FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, II	The Last Judgment	Oil on oak, 47 x 32 cm	1605-10	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
35516-48mythol.jpg	"The source of the subject is Ovid's Metamorphoses.The love affairs of gods never bode well for mortals; there were times when they caused nothing but suffering even for some of the nymphs. Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard. The inventive god (the Greeks called him ""Hermes dolios"", the schemer) approached the meadows, herding some goats which he had stolen along the way, and played songs on his pipe. The guard was charmed by the new and masterful melodies.Mercury watches intently as Argus is mesmerized by the sound of the flute, and he is already reaching for the weapon with which he will behead the sleepy guardian.Rubens depicted a fipple flute in place of a Pan-pipe. From the aulos used at feasts of Antiquity and the Roman tibia through the medieval bagpipes and Renaissance-Baroque horns and musettes, all the way to the saxophone of our times, every wind instrument was attributed with having a dangerous mesmerizing power"	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Mercury and Argus	Oil on panel, 63 x 87,5 cm	1635-38	mythological	Flemish	1601-1650
29968-winter_n.jpg	The painting depicts a winter landscape with figures on a frozen river, a town beyond. Highlighted near the centre, a group of figures stand in conversation, amongst whom a white horse - a recurring motif in Isaac van Ostade's work - stands with its head bowed.The theme of crowded winter landscapes, pioneered by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, became extremely popular in the seventeenth century. It was one of van Ostade's favourite subjects, and he became one of the genre's finest exponents	OSTADE, Isaack van	Winter Landscape	Oil on panel, 51 x 77 cm	-	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
36455-adoratio.jpg	This is a fine example of Savoldo's mature work. He painted various versions of the same ever-popular subject, but the Brescia painting is the most concentrated and convincing. It reveals Savoldo's appealing poetic sentiment which is demonstrated through the simple and direct gestures of the characters, fully expressing their humanity. The light is subtle and the details build up an impressive feeling of realism. Savoldo's true forte was for night scenes like this, which let him give his liking for unusual light effects full play. Particularly noteworthy is the contrast of the dark background and the brilliantly yet softly illuminated figures in the foreground	SAVOLDO, Giovanni Girolamo	Adoration of the Shepherds	Wood	c. 1540	religious	Italian	1501-1550

37681-luteplay.jpg	The Lute Player exemplifies Sorgh's approach to fashionable imagery in his later years. He depicts a young dandy with a double-necked lute serenading the unimpressed recipient of his affections in a gated veranda before an urban setting. The painting is obviously replete with references to love and courtship. Playing musical instruments was long considered indispensable to fostering Eros and in this sense, Sorgh's foppish, lute player is entirely conventional.	SORGH, Hendrick Maertensz.

25224-karlstei.jpg	Master Theoderic, a highly original artist, broke free of the styles that were dominated by Italian, Austrian and French art and tried to develop his own distinctive style. Painted between 1360 and 1365, the 30 icon-like portraits of the saints which decorate the Chapel of the Cross at Karlstein Castle are one of the most impressive results of these efforts. The robust features of the individual saints are impressively depicted.Three-dimensional objects have been added, such as carved coats-of-arms, mounted in the manner of collages on the surface of the paintings. Ornamented with discs of gilded Venetian glass and strips of marble encrusted with semiprecious stones, the chapel seems like a Byzantine treasure chamber. It is possible that this room and the adjacent 'privatorium' were intended by the Emperor to create a vision of his future Eastern empire	MASTER THEODERIC	Paintings of Saints	Tempera on wood	1360-65	religious	Bohemian	1351-1400
28553-argent13.jpg	Till 1878 Monet lived at Argenteuil. The two road and rail bridges rebuilt after the war were a subject Monet repeatedly painted, and here he could experiment with the spatial effects of diagonals.

06109-fugger_c.jpg	"It is presumed that Sebastian Loscher and Hans Burgkmair were jointly responsible for the plans for the Fugger Chapel. The architecture of this family vault for Jakob, Ulrich, and Georg Fugger, which was consecrated in 1518, introduced the vocabulary of the early Italian Renaissance to Germany for the first time. The contemporary furnishings, with sculptures by the Daucher workshop and the painted organ shutters by Jörg Breu the Elder, are important works of the Renaissance, which reached the north of Europe in the early 16th century.The Fuggers were a Swabian merchant and banking family who were also major patrons of the arts, established in Augsburg from 1367. The founder of the Fugger trading house was Jacob I (d. 1469), but the fame and wealth of the family was due to his sons Ulrich (1441-1510), Georg (1453-1506), and Jakob II (""the Rich,"" 1459-1525), founder of the Fugger Chapel in St. Anna's church in Augsburg.

00781-3predel4.jpg	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. In this scene Joseph, the Virgin, the High Priest and St Anne stand in the foreground, a nave of receding columns extending backwards behind them.

25901-port_art.jpg	Luis Meléndez trained under his father Francisco Antonio Meléndez (1682-1752), a specialist royal portrait miniaturist, who was instrumental in the encouragement of Philip V to establish an academy of fine arts in Madrid, which he eventually founded in 1744, making the artist an honorary director of painting. Luis Meléndez was one of the first students admitted into the new academy (which was later named the Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1753), where he rapidly excelled in the art of drawing, an event celebrated in his handsome self-portrait (and remarkably the only known portrait by Meléndez) of 1746, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. The highly accomplished skill displayed in this portrait reflects the experience gained by the artist during his apprenticeship to the royal portrait painter Louis-Michel van Loo from 1738 until 1744.

Plump and self-confident, the Bergamasque noblewoman stands out with vibrating luminosity against the dark background. In this portrait Lotto mixes various features, namely the sense of belonging to the peaceful life of Bergamo, the ability to depict the sitters extremely vividly and the fondness for plays on words. In fact, the lady's name is concealed in a rebus: in the moon (luna in Italian) on the left the letters CI appear, thus form Lu-ci-na	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Portrait of Lucina Brembati	Oil on panel, 53 x 45 cm	c. 1518	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

The delicately rendered strands of his graying hair and the salt-and-pepper stubble of his beard, as well as his deeply lined jowls, sagging double chin, and the crow's-feet at the edge of his left eye, are closely observed.This painting was once attributed to Hans Holbein. However, the style and execution are typical of Gossart's, rather than Holbein's works. Such portraits of modest size, tightly cropped, and featuring a plain dark green background were parrt of Gossart's standard output	GOSSART, Jan	Portrait of a Man	Oil on oak panel, 34 x 24 cm	1525-30	portrait	Flemish	1501-1550
30134-company.jpg	This painting depicts a gathering of thirteen expensively dressed young men and women who are enjoying the pleasure of eating, drinking, smoking, and making music in each other's company. As is often the case in Palamedesz's interiors, a group of people is crowded into the right half of the picture, leaving the space at the left almost empty. This imbalance is compensated by placing in the empty corner the figure of the servant boy dressed in red and pouring wine for the merrymakers.This painting is strongly reminiscent of works with similar subject matter by artists active in northern Holland, such as Dirck Hals, Pieter Codde, Willem Duyster, and Hendrick Pot	PALAMEDESZ., Anthonie	Company Dining and Making Music	Oil on panel, 47 x 73 cm	1632	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
44073-3froimo2.jpg	The name of the subject of the portrait was deduced from the grisaille on the reverse side of the panel. The patterned background resembling a hanging is different from the usual neutral backgrounds of Rogier's portraits. In addition, the donor's face seems more softly but less artistically modeled than in those portraits. Since dendrochronology suggests the date of 1469 for the panel showing the donor, the diptych may have been painted by the workshop after Rogier's death	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (right wing)	Oil on oak panel, 49,3 x 31,5 cm	1460s	portrait	Flemish	1401-1450
13414-21paele.jpg	"Here the visual and thematic elements are similar to those of the Chancellor Rolin Madonna. Van Eyck is concerned with showing the presence of a vision and therefore of illustrating the reality of God in our world. Just as Nicolas Rolin is shown in his palace, in the midst of an identifiable environment that seems to make his vision of the Virgin all the more real, so Canon van der Paele is shown in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Donatian in Bruges, where he is being presented to the Virgin by St. George and St. Donatian. Hans Belting is of the opinion that this picture once hung in the choir of the now destroyed church. This would mean that the depicted location mirrored the real location. Van der Paele would therefore have been able to see himself in the very place of his depicted vision and so ""prove"" to the world at large the reality of his divine experience.The exquisite brocades, furs, and silks are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility. On the other hand, the reliefs and sculptures on the capitals in the background and on the Virgin's throne all allude to Christ's salvation of humanity. The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world. Redemption from sin (Cain killing his brother) is possible only through the power of faith (Samson overpowering the lion). The goodness and grace of God ""at the moment of truth"" (Abraham sacrificing Isaac) serves as proof of the redeeming power and presence of servants of God both celestial (St. George) and mortal (Canon van der Paele).This is how van der Paele might have expressed the message of the painting-that paradise was at hand-a message confirmed by its being set in a very real but also sacred context. The Virgin is pictures holding a nosegay and her son a parrot - unmistakable echoes of the Garden of Eden - and both figures have turned to face the meditating canon"	EYCK, Jan van	The Madonna with Canon van der Paele	Oil on wood, 122 x 157 cm	1436	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

23057-40nichol.jpg	The panel (and another also in the Uffizi) came from the church of St Procolo in Florence where it was recorded by Vasari. Presumably it was painted as side wing of a triptych which had a figure of St Nicholas in the central panel (which has disappeared) during the second visit of Ambrogio to Florence between 1327 and 1332, or later. Another possibility is that the panels made up a tabernacle door.The upper scene represents the resurrection of the dead child.

14084-chevalie.jpg	This is the leftt wing of a diptych, originally located in Melun. The right wing showing the Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels is in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp.Estienne Chevalier, who came from Melun, was French Ambassador to England in 1445 and six years later became Treasurer to Charles VII of France. He presented the diptych of which this panel forms the left wing, to his native town; on this wing he had himself painted next to his patron saint, Stephen. The saint, wearing a deacon's robe, is holding a book, on which a jagged stone is lying, as a symbol of his martyrdom. The formal architecture in the background is in the Italian Renaissance style showing pilasters with coloured inlaid marble panels between them. On the wall, receding in perspective, the name Estienne Chevalier is inscribed several times. Originally the donor and the saint were looking towards the Madonna, who occupied the right wing of the diptych; this panel found its way into the Antwerp Museum.According to a description of the paintings by Denis Godefroy in 1661, the original frames were covered in blue velvet. Round each picture were strands of gold and silver thread, in which the donor's initials were woven in pearls. There were also gilded medallions on which stories of the saints were represented.Tradition has it - and there is considerable supporting evidence - that the Madonna's features are those of Agnes Sorel, the beautiful and influential mistress of Charles VII. Known portraits of her certainly do not conflict with this hypothesis. Her relationship with Estienne Chevalier was not entirely political, and an eighteenth-century inscription on the back of the Antwerp panel tells us that the diptych of Melun was endowed by Estienne following a vow he made on her death in 1450. The diptych was in the chancel of the Church of Notre-Dame at Melun, south of Paris, from 1461 until about 1775, when the two halves became separated.The date of Agnes Sorel's death is not the only reason for assuming that the diptych was painted around 1450. At any later period the cut of Estienne's robe would no longer have been in fashion. A few years earlier, between 1443 and 1447, Fouquet had been in Italy and the background of the Berlin panel is clearly the result of what he saw there. After returning from the south, he settled in his birthplace, Tours. From then on he worked for Charles VII and the court and became the leading exponent of the French Court style	FOUQUET, Jean	Melun Diptych: Estienne Chevalier with St Stephen	Wood, 93 x 85 cm	c. 1450	portrait	French	1451-1500

32309-07moses.jpg	This painting, the latest and grandest of Poussin's three versions of the theme, was acquired by the National Gallery jointly with the National Museum of Wales in 1988 and is shown alternately in London and Cardiff. Poussin illustrated events from the life of Moses at least nineteen times. It has been pointed out that when he could, he avoided painting scenes of saintly visions or martyrdoms, the stock-in-trade of seventeenth-century religious art. He concentrated instead on the central themes of Christianity, relating them both to their historical context in the ancient Near East and to the basic tenets of other religions, following an intellectual fashion of the day. Of the Old Testament subjects which he painted, the majority belong to the category of types, or prefigurations, of Salvation.From Early Christian times the Old Testament was read by Christians for its analogies with the New. Thus the waters of the Nile to which the infant Moses is consigned by his mother in 'an ark of bulrushes', following Pharaoh's cruel order to drown all the male Israelite babies (Exodus 1:2), were likened to the waters of baptism. But Poussin's interest in Moses may have been prompted also by his identification with pagan deities; as a contemporary writer influenced by these ideas wrote of this picture: 'He is Moses, the Mosche of the Hebrews, the Pan of the Arcadians, the Priapus of the Hellespont, the Anubis of the Egyptians.'All these ideas reverberate throughout the painting. The baby on whom Pharaoh's daughter has taken pity resembles the Christ Child blessing the Magi or the shepherds in a scene of the Adoration. In the background on the left an Egyptian priest worships the dog-shaped god Anubis (barely visible now that the surface paint has grown thin and transparent). We know we are in Egypt because on the rock above the main scene a river god, symbolising the Nile, embraces a sphinx, palm trees stand on the shore and an obelisk rises up behind a stately temple. (Curiously, the many-windowed buildings with which Poussin, who had never been there, endows Pharaoh's country now resemble modern resort hotels.)The main interest and beauty of the painting, however, do not reside in its possible symbolism, but in the wonderful grouping of the figures, all women to contrast with an analogous group of men in Christ healing the Blind Man (now in the Louvre), painted for the same patron the year before. Each plays her role in the dramatic tale, the princess generous and commanding, the maids curious and delighted. The humbler figure in a white shift at Moses' head may be his sister who watched from nearby to see what would happen to him, and recommended their mother to Pharaoh's daughter as a wet nurse. It is tempting to see their brilliant draperies as a compliment to Poussin's patron, the Lyon silk merchant Reynon. Bodies and colours, each distinct and separate, combine in ample rhythms across the picture surface, echoed by the rocks beyond. It is at once solemn and joyful, as befits a scene in which a child is rescued from death, and through him an entire people is saved.

44473-catherin.jpg	Legend has it that in the reign of the Emperor Maxentius there lived a girl known as Catherine of Alexandria who was as intelligent and wise in debate as she was beautiful to look upon. During the last years of pagan Rome she emerged victorious from every verbal encounter with the Roman sages and it was for this reason that, at the Emperor's order, on the 25th of November, in the year 307 A.D., she was broken on the wheel and then beheaded. Catherine's emblems are therefore the wheel, the sword, the palm-branch and the book, the first two representing her martyrdom, the others her wisdom.Both her life and her death were favourite subjects for paintings in the Middle Ages, chosen even by the greatest artists of the Renaissance when it was only possible to paint a beautiful woman in the guise of a saint. Thus in this painting by Yá&#241;ez we are shown a gentle young girl with a Leonardo-like smile, colourfully dressed and posed against a richly detailed background. Yá&#241;ez was an artist of the Spanish Renaissance who, though influenced by Italian art, retained the vivid colouring and meticulous detail of the Flemish tradition	YÁ?EZ DE LA ALMEDINA, Fernando	Saint Catherine	Oil on canvas, 212 x 112 cm	1505-10	religious	Spanish	1501-1550

Originally Preti was also supposed to paint the smaller panels above the passages to the presbytery chapels. Because of a litigation, he never actually did so, and the two panels were ultimately executed by the Albani pupils Carlo Cignani and Emilio Taruffi.

25092-joseph.jpg	"Unknown Flemish master, a follower of Rogier van der Weyden. He got his name from the six tondos representing scenes from the Joseph legend of the Old Testament.Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison."

08683-08waterj.jpg	Diderot could have no higher praise of a Chardin still-life than to say: 'C'est la nature m&#234;me.' And for him Chardin remained the great magician-painter whose canvases deceived the eye by their tremendous realism, down to the very textures of the objects painted. Such pictures kept the spectator completely within his own experience, and to some extent that is true of all the pictures painted by Chardin - including those genre scenes which were executed chiefly in the years before Diderot wrote of the Salons, but which are also in their way still-lives. Neither category of picture was novel, and Chardin might seem merely to be practicing what had been among the most typical products of Dutch seventeenth-century painting	CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon	Water Glass and Jug	Oil on canvas, 32,5 x 41 cm	c. 1760	still-life	French	1701-1750

It is not certain that the subject is really the Field Marshal Lucio Foppa, about whom there is little documentation.The only remaining example of the genre of painting for which Figino was famous among his contemporaries, this portrait also reveals the varied influences on the artist. Although it shows reminiscences of Flemish painting, the portrait is more openly ""cavalier,"" with the noble subject posed as if on a stage. The composition plays on the contrast between the closed profile on the right and the open one on the left. The latter relates to the decorative details of the chiseled helmet, the flowers and the feathers, which are all touched by incisive highlights. Notations of light also appear on the lace of the collar and the sleeves, which correspond to the flowers and fruit on the table.

12476-05sorrow.jpg	This work depicts Jesus after he had been scourged and mocked by the soldiers, just before he was led away to be crucified. Jesus bleeds profusely from his wounds and he holds the instruments used to beat him, a three-knotted whip and bundle of birches. He wears the crown of thorns, leaning his head on his right hand in a gesture of grief. His other hand rests on a ledge, a pose which Dürer often used to add a sense of depth to a portrait. The face is painted with great realism. Set against a gold background, Christ stares out of the picture, expressing resignation at his fate.This devotional panel was identified as a Dürer in 1941 and although unsigned it is now widely accepted as a work by the young artist. It dates from his journeyman days and may well have been done in Strasbourg, probably in 1493 or early in 1494	DÜRER, Albrecht	Christ as the Man of Sorrows	Oil on panel, 30 x 19 cm	c. 1493	religious	German	1501-1550
04023-1hunyadi.jpg	"The great solemnity of historical paintings was especially apparent in the large pictures by Gyula Benczúr. His master, Piloty, concerned himself with stage-like scenes from the history of Europe, but Benczúr who great up in Kassa in the turmoil of the War of Independence, felt that it was more important to depict Hungarian history. This early work of his, ""László Hunyadi's Farewell"", alredy shows his particular talent for composition, human characterization and realistic rendering. There is deep sorrow on the face of László Hunyadi, the central figure, and one feels his tragic fate looming over the paintful farewell of his friends, Subdued light falls on the group and is reflected from the white walls that are painted with masterly realism.The great succes of this painting marked the beginning of Benczúr's sparkling artistic career. He first exhibited it in Pest in 1867 and then in Paris with the works of eleven other Hungarian painters. In 1869, the Pest Picture Gallery Association bought it for the Hungarian National Museum. It became so popular that the weekly magazine ""Hazánk"" (Our Native Land) reproduced it as a colour supplement in the 1870s"	BENCZÚR, Gyula	László Hunyadi's Farewell	Oil on canvas, 147 x 121 cm	1866	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

13640-17ferenc.jpg	"The laid table with armchairs around it in the garden of the Ferenczy family often appeared in  Ferenczy's pictures (""Sunny Evening"", 1904, ""Sunny Morning"", 1905, and ""The Prodigal Son"", 1908). ""Sunny Morning"", like ""October"", showed an idyllic scene in a little town. Ferenczy views the bright and  peaceful subject not as a humorous one, his considerations as artist make his pictures more than mere genre pictures. The morning sunshine penetrates under the branches of the walnut tree. Eyes are drawn to the table with white table cloth. Shadows of objects (a fruit basket, apples and a blue carafe) are projected on it, together with the delicate shadow of the basket chair which is not in the picture. The natural posture  of people sitting around the table is a part  of  the arrangement. The edge of the table running diagonally is accentuated by the arm and trunk of the female figure who is leaning back in the armchair and by the borderline between light and shadow on the leaves.Ferenczy's composition at this time was characterized by István Réti as follows: ""... he places his figures into narrow space and full figures. It is carefully decided on the basis of proportions and patches how much of them should be portrayed. Proportion of space is shifted towards figures, what does not diminish the importance of  atmospheres in the pictures ..."". The contrast of surfaces in light and shadow is definite. The way he painted the warm colours of faces which are in the shadow of hats is simply superb, just like the grey silk dress. Ferenczy's style of painting is more dynamic and delicate coloured at the same, mow that he gave up his previous plain style"	FERENCZY, Károly	Sunny Morning	Oil on canvas, 92 x 93 cm	1905	landscape	Hungarian	1851-1900

05801-1simon.jpg	Dirk Bouts came from Haarlem, where he doubtless received his early training. Later he settled in the university city of Louvain, where his major work can still be seen in the Church of St Peter. When he was appointed City Painter in 1468, he was already over fifty years old. The Berlin panel, as its close likeness to the work of Aelbert Ouwater suggests, must have been one of his earlier works.The story of Jesus's visit to the house of Simon the Pharisee is told in St Luke's Gospel (vii, 36-50). A woman from the city followed Christ there, 'and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.' Simon condemned the attitude of his guest, saying : 'This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.' Christ answered with a parable and the words: 'Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.'In a narrow, vaulted room, on the left of which is a window providing a glimpse of a landscape, Simon sits with his guests at a table laid for a meal. On the left of the table the sinner bends down to anoint Jesus's feet. The host, the only one present wearing shoes, and Peter beside him, observe the incident with astonishment and disapproval. The youthful John at the head of the table seems to be drawing the attention of the donor, a Dominican monk, to it. The latter kneels with hands raised in prayer and, as if he dare not look, averts his gaze.The arrangement of the figures at a laid table recalls two other themes from the life of Christ, the Last Supper and the Miracle at Emmaus, incidents which were frequently represented in painting and, furthermore, established a pictorial tradition of their own. Here the table is laid with bread, wine and fish, the last of these being an ancient Christian symbol. The composition of the various objects represents one of the most delightful still-lifes in old Netherlandish painting. Among the vessels on the table one can recognize a late medieval form of glass known as a 'cabbage-stalk'	BOUTS, Dieric the Elder	Christ in the House of Simon	Oil on wood, 40,5 x 61 cm	1440s	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

21141-view_squ.jpg	K&#248;bke is one of the most distinguished of the so-called painters of the Danish Golden Age, whose work represents a brilliant contribution to nineteenth- century European art. He started training as an artist at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen in 1822, and from 1828 became a student of C.W. Eckersberg. K&#248;bke usually painted small-scale pictures of great precision - landscapes, studies of architectural subjects and portraits of his family and friends. Whatever the subject, he invariably combined carefully observed, often richly coloured naturalistic details, with a sense of controlled abstract design.This painting was made in about 1830, when he was developing his mature style, and shows the bakery in the Kastel, which is a castle in Copenhagen that served as a prison. The three figures in the foreground are K&#248;bke's father, who owned the bakery, Major J.J. Krohn, and the slave Sergeant Sporch (the prisoners were described as 'slaves'). The scene was one with which K&#248;bke was very familiar as he lived within the castle compound from 1817 to 1834. In the later 1830s his family moved out of Copenhagen and he concentrated on depicting more rural scenes; subsequent visits to Germany and Italy broadened the scope of his subject matter still further	K?BKE, Christen	A View of the Square in the Kastel Looking Towards the Ramparts	Oil on canvas, 30 x 23 cm	c. 1830	landscape	Danish	1801-1850

Dominating the scene (and painted in as an afterthought) is instructor Jules Perrot, with the huge stick he used to beat out a rhythm.

12572-6apostl.jpg	Dürer's monogram and the date are visible in the upper part of the two canvases, which are part of a series of twelve heads of apostles which the artist planned, though never completed. The two heads are constructed with an incisive and meticulous line, a reflection of Dürer's troubled search for moral austerity. We may recall that this was a particularly delicate time in German history, shortly before the emergence of Martin Luther and the Reformation.The two saints inspire a diffuse sense of solemn veneration, in the passionate, severe eyes, the embittered curve of the mouths, and the overabundant beards, depicted as heavy, noble masses of coiling hair	DÜRER, Albrecht	The Apostles Philip and James	Tempera on canvas, 45 x 38 and 46 x 37 cm	1516	religious	German	1501-1550
33608-13group.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Sampling Officials of the Drapers' Guild	Oil on canvas, 192 x 279 cm	1662	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
11939-sopron.jpg	"The altarpiece of St. George church in Sopron is one of those rare Baroque compositions which are not a simple devotional picture or a copy of one, but a so-called picture in picture. This type of composition, apart from intensifying the pictorial effect, always refers to some important aspects of the history of devotion of the central picture.In the middle of this altarpieces, in an elegant Louis XIV. style golden frame set out whit laurel festoons and bows of ribbons, is shown the image of the Virgin of Genazzano, at that time famous all over the world, with her special appellation written in a banderole: Maria von guten, Rath, Mother of Good Advice (Aurenhammer 1956. 110-111).The prototype of the Eleousa-type devotional picture was an Albanian Treccento fresco from the church of Skutari, delivered from the Turkish invaders in 1467 the Augustinian hermits in Genazzano near Roma. Its veneration spread by means of copies made for other churches of the order, and won popularity through the pious brotherhoods founded for its honour. The cult of the Mother of Good Advice - obviously because of its anti-Islamic aspects - was encouraged by Pope Innocent XI, so in the 17th and 18th centuries it flourished not only within the order but throughout the whole Catholic Church.In Hungary the altarpieces representing the Mother of Good Advice sometimes also show the angels who, according to the legend, flew with the devotional picture and brought it to its place.The representation of this scene may come from a copperplate of Sebestyén Zeller, an engraver in Pozsony. In Sopron, however, the substitution of this usual environment for an allegorical natural landscape transmits an entirely original, thus far unknown  meaning of the iconography of the picture. The tree struck by lightning and the shattered ancient idol with lire, in his hand had already lost much of their topicallity at the time as symbols for the enemies of the pervious centuries (pagans, Turks, the Reformation). The literary products of the Enlightenment which spread even by way of leaflets, engendered a grave spiritual crisis, disrupting even the traditional unity of the clergy. The verse of psalm written in front of the flashing thunderbolts at the two sides of the picture: Verstummen müssen - falsche Lettzen, Ps. 30. v. 19. (Let the lying lips be put to silence, Psalm 31, 18) gives us a very perceptible rendering of the mood of the belivers confused in their traditional religiosity. With the dark clouds in the background Dorffmaister presents us with a picturesque and inventive representation of the shock that befell the faith before omnipotence of reason, and makes us feel the atmosphere of the crisis caused in many contemporaries by awareness of helplessness.It is in this stormy, almost pre-Romantic landscape in this ""mirror of the soul"" that the gentle look of the Mother of Good Advice and that of the Child on her breast might have been an ""apology"" of orientation and inner satisfaction for everybody having recourse to her"	DORFFMEISTER, István	The Mother of Good Advice	Oil on canvas, 167 x 102 cm	1781	religious	Hungarian	1751-1800
43452-leiden.jpg	In their sheer abundance and variety, Van Vliet's paintings of church interiors create the impression of a commercial enterprise. This was nothing new in the world of Dutch art but it was new to the genre in Delft. Van Vliet's production was consistent and systematic. His constant search for new views in the churches of Delft, his trips to other towns and his use of standard schemes indicate work for the open market.The paintings shows a view of the interior in the Pieterskerk in Leiden from the northern transept to the southwest. This is the earliest known dated architectural painting by Van Vliet. It employs Houckgeest's type of oblique perspective scheme, and an illusionistic archway and curtain	VLIET, Hendrick Cornelisz. van	The Pieterskerk in Leiden	Oil on panel, 98 x 82 cm	1652	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
08445-stil_lif.jpg	This still-life with herring, lobster, turbot, red mullet, oysters, gurnard, lemon, chicory root, carrots, onions, terracotta pot and ladle, and straw flask, was executed during the artist's stay in Venice, from about 1736 to 1742. Connections with Venetian painting are evident in the soft, quivering brushwork and the sumptuous, refined sense of colour, enhanced by the bright orange tonalities of the lobster, the brilliant red of the mullet, and the golden yellow of the lemon	CERUTI, Giacomo	Still-Life	Oil on canvas, 63 x 68 cm	1736-42	still-life	Italian	1701-1750

18489-septimiu.jpg	This painting by Greuze is frankly Poussin-like. The artist wished to be recognized as a history painter; he chose an obscure subject to illustrate:  Septimius Severus Roman emperor (146-211) reproaches his son, Caracalla for trying to assasinate him. Varied emotions are at work within it: from Caracalla's angry shame to the surprise of the chamberlain, Castor, at the emperor's recklessly heroic gesture which is at once a challenge and a rebuke	GREUZE, Jean-Baptiste	Septimius Severus and Caracalla	Oil on canvas, 124 x 160 cm	1769	historical	French	1751-1800

The Resurrection was the central panel of this altarpiece. It is assumed that Leonardo da Vinci provided a refined drawing for the composition. The figures of the two saints were painted by Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio.	OGGIONO, Marco d'	Resurrection of Christ with Sts Leonardo and Lucy	Oil on panel	1491-94	religious	Italian	1451-1500
11662-giustini.jpg	Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicit&#224; Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidotti in 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichino in 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Sala di Diana, Domenichino concentrated his pictures on the ceiling, fitting them into a geometrical system patterned after the Galleria Farnese. The pictures depict scenes of the moon goddess Diana	DOMENICHINO	Scenes of Diana	Fresco	1609-10	religious	Italian	1601-1650
24063-2sposi111.jpg	The detail of the west wall shows a grotesque self-portrai of the artist.Hidden in the foliate decor of one of the room's painted pilasters, right next to the painted plaque above the door containing the painter's dedication of the work, is a face that has been commonly identified as the artist's self-portrait. Its resemblance to the bronze portrait bust from roughly 1490 in the church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua, is unmistakable, even though this painted likeness does not wear the arrogant and somewhat surly expression that his contemporaries tell us was characteristic of the artist	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Grotesque Self-Portrait	Walnut oil on plaster	1465-74	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

02622-07arella.jpg	This impressive still-life represents one of the finest achievements by the pre-eminent flower painter of 17th century Spain, Juan de Arellano. The painting was produced at the height of the artist's career and is remarkable for the quality of execution.

38561-cobbler.jpg	This painting renowned work in the eighteenth century, partly due to its dissemination through engravings. It was the source of inspiration for a number of French artists, perhaps most notably Jean-Siméon Chardin. There is a direct connection between the present painting and one of Chardin's work in the Louvre, The Canary, which shows a woman teaching her canary to sing. The two works not only share thematic similarities, but also compositional ones.The painting is signed and dated lower right, on the work bench: 'D: TENIERS &#183; FEC A 1671'	TENIERS, David the Younger	A Cobbler in his Workshop	Oil on canvas, 37 x 28 cm	1671	genre	Flemish	1651-1700

36803-death_a.jpg	Of the many painters who assimilated and vulgarised the contemplative, romantic manner of Giorgione, Sebastiano del Piombo was inspired by the monumental form and by the possibility of making it solemn with the use of colour. It is precisely in this contained plasticism that we find the result of the integration of the two pictorial cultures. This painting shows a still Giorgionesque atmosphere - the view of the lake and the sunset - in which three superb examples of sculptural nudity are inserted: a doleful Venus, and her attendant maidservants, who turn abruptly to silence a bearded Pan who is continuing to play his flute	SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO	Death of Adonis	Oil on canvas, 189 x 285 cm	1511-12	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

44721-farnese1.jpg	The art-historical importance of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, near Viterbo, is the famous pentagonal ground plan and round interior courtyard, and the interior frescoes. The Palazzo was built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) who was made cardinal by his grandfather Pope Paul III (1468-1549), and named vice chancellor of the Holy Roman Church a year later, according him the highest position after that of the pope in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.The architect of the construction, Giacomo da Vignola, found that the form of the ground plan and the site of the building were dictated by an incomplete fortress begun in the 1530s by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger - a project that had not gone further than the exterior walls on the ground floor. Vignola approached the unfinished structure as a challenge and opportunity to create a unique solution. What was built from 1559 onward had the form of a fortress and the function of a villa, but was in its extravagance an urban palace.The commission for the interior decoration went to Taddeo Zuccaro, who was to make drawings and cartoons for the painting and stucco work but he had to work there only to review from time to time the work that had been carried out there. He largely assigned the execution to others, in particular his brother Federico. After the death of Taddeo Zuccaro in 1566, his younger brother Federico continued the work until 1569. His successor was Jacopo Bertoia, then Giovanni de' Vecchi, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio.The principle according to which the walls and ceilings were painted was retained for all apartments: only in public rooms (halls and their antechambers) were frescoes painted on ceilings and walls, while painting in the private rooms was limited to the vaults, with walls covered in silk, brocade, and similar materials. The themes painted in the ground floor apartments, intended for various uses by guests, are all taken from classical mythology.  The themes of the apartments situated above these on the piano nobile focus decidedly on the master of the house and the function of the individual rooms.In the two rooms on the piano nobile suited for a larger public, the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani and the Sala del Concilio, Taddeo Zuccaro painted a cycle depicting, in a total of twenty-three scenes, the history of the Farnese family	ZUCCARO, Taddeo	General view of the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani	Fresco	1562-63	historical	Italian	1551-1600
39463-03adamev.jpg	This work together with the Creation of Animals and the Murder of Abel, created between 1550 and 1553, was originally in the Scuola della Trinit&#224;.Adam and Eve are depicted not in a landscape thrown into confusion by the hand of the Creator but in a more serene, more human dimension. In the leafy arbour the two nude figures moving around the trunk of the tree form the parallel diagonals of the composition. A strong light gives a sculptural effect to their ivory-pink flesh. But in the background, on the right, the tranquillity of the foreground scene gives way to the tumultuous epilogue to the fact of human disobedience to Divine will. With rapid brushstrokes Tintoretto evokes the fiery angel who drives Adam and Eve out into the distant desolate hills and plains.Eve, temptation personified, is pressing close to the tree of knowledge; her arms prolong the line of the serpent thrusting down from above. Tintoretto confidently shows that he has now perfectly mastered not only the sculptural structure of a muscular, sinewy male body (a particular strength of Florentine painters, especially of Michelangelo) but also the reproduction of female grace and tenderness (the domain of Venetian artists, particularly Titian).The model for Adam is a chiaroscuro woodcut by Antonio da Trento	TINTORETTO	The Temptation of Adam	Oil on canvas, 150 x 220 cm	1551-52	religious	Italian	1551-1600

23262-05head.jpg	A fine youthful work but partially repainted. It was done under the influence of Dürer and Jacopo de' Barbari. It is small, but life-size. Even in this work from his earliest period, the sitter's fully frontal posture is characteristic of Lotto's portraits, and so is the lively sense of personality that emerges from the close-up.In the 18th-century inventories the painting appeared as the portrait of Raphael, executed by Leonardo da Vinci, an assumption based on the soft, atmospheric modeling, the intense psychological penetration, and the traditional iconography of Raphael, who had always been seen as a delicate, elegant and refined youth. Recent X-rays, however, have revealed a previous portrait, completely different the one executed	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Head of a Young Man	Oil on wood, 28 x 23 cm	c. 1505	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
04579-playlute.jpg	Bijlert was connected with the Utrecht circle of Caravaggists, who included Honthorst and Terbrugghen, and like them spent time in Rome around 1621.

21468-queen.jpg	Three fancy-dress balls were held at Buckingham Palace by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, each in a different style. At the first on 12 May 1842 the principal figures appeared as Edward III (1312-77) and Queen Philippa (1314?-69). The second, on 6 June 1845, was in early Georgian dress and the third, on 13 June 1851, in the style of the Restoration.Landseer has painted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Throne Room on the occasion of the fancy-dress ball of 1842, standing beneath a specially designed Gothic canopy decorated with purple velvet hangings. Two chairs of state are visible behind the figures and above their heads on the cloth of honour is emblazoned the coat-of-arms of Edward III, combining French and English quarterings. It was from this alcove that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert greeted over 2,000 guests. Members of the Royal Household were expected to appear in costumes dating in style from the reign of Edward III, while the guests were encouraged to wear costumes of any period or country. The setting for the ball and the design of the costumes were entrusted to James Robinson Planche, who was an authority on the history of dress, as evidenced by his encyclopaedic book History of British Costume (1834), as well as a dramatist and a herald in the College of Arms.The costumes worn by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were designed by Vouillon and Laure with the guidance of Planche. For the sake of accuracy reference was made to the relevant monuments in Westminster Abbey. The queen's costume was based upon the effigies of Philippa of Hainault and her daughter Blanche de la Tour (died in infancy 1342), while that for Prince Albert was derived from the effigy of Edward III. Landseer began his painting at the time of the ball, but, as was so often the case with this artist, progress was delayed and the picture was not finished until 1846.

39256-09george.jpg	St George and the Dragon is a small, even miniature, painting in the context of Tintoretto's work, detailed and highly finished. It was probably commissioned as a private altarpiece, and the conventional arched vertical format had never before, and has rarely since, been used to such dynamic and disturbing effect. The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground. St George has galloped into the painting from our right, the direction of a hidden source of light which picks out the trunks of the trees, the rump of the horse, the armour of the knight and the flesh and garments of Cleodolinda	TINTORETTO	St George and the Dragon	Oil on canvas, 158 x 100 cm	1555-58	religious	Italian	1551-1600
42379-council.jpg	The most famous admiral in Dutch history, Michiel de Ruyter, enjoyed an international reputation and received numerous honours from other countries. De Ruyter was born in Flushing port in 1607, and first went to sea when he was only eleven years old. His navigating skills brought him rapid advancement. De Ruyter was employed by the Admiralty, in Zeeland in 1652 and in Amsterdam a year later. As vice-admiral of the fleet he took part in the numerous sea battles the Dutch fought against England. In 1665 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet. He won a number of victories, but the pinnacle of his career was undoubtedly the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672-1674), in which his superior tactics enabled him to keep a large Anglo-French fleet away from the Dutch coast. De Ruyter was killed at Syracuse in 1676, and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam.This pen drawing by Willem van de Velde depicts the council of war on the eve of the four-day naval battle during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667). The battle, which took place on 11-14 June 1666, was won by the Dutch fleet under De Ruyter's command. The result, however, was disappointing: the English fleet was not destroyed, and losses on the Dutch side were almost as great	VELDE, Willem van de, the Elder	The Council of War on Board 'De Zeven Provincien', the Flagship of Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter, on 10 June 1666	Oil on canvas, 117 x 175 cm	1666	historical	Dutch	1651-1700

04413-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.

43366-sacra_co.jpg	The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date. The panel is signed and dated on the dais of the throne	VIVARINI, Alvise	Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Sacra Conversazione)	Tempera on wood, 175 x 196 cm	1480	religious	Italian	1451-1500
19904-02seymou.jpg	Jane Seymour (1509-1537) was the third wife of King Henry VIII of England and mother of King Edward VI. She succeeded - where Henry's previous wives had failed - in providing a legitimate male heir to the throne.Jane's father was Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, Savernake, Wiltshire. She became a lady in waiting to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then to Anne Boleyn, who married the King in 1533. Henry probably became attracted to Jane in 1535, when he visited her father at Wolf Hall, but, though willing to marry him, she refused to be his mistress. That determination undoubtedly helped bring about Anne Boleyn's downfall and execution (May 19, 1536). On May 30, 1536, Henry and Jane were married privately.During the remaining 17 months of her life Jane managed to restore Mary, Henry's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, to the King's favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and some scholars have interpreted Jane's intercession to mean that she had little sympathy with the English Reformation. The future Edward VI was born on October 12, 1537, but, to Henry's genuine sorrow, Jane died 12 days later.Holbein executed this portrait shortly after the marriage of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. In attitude and expression, the Seymour portrait matches that in the Whitehall composition, but the portraits differ in the arrangement of the bonnet veil; this individual portrait follows the preparatory study in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. This change is important only from a compositional point of view, and probably derived from Holbein himself. However, the major changes in tonality and patterns in Jane's gown will probably have been undertaken only after consultation with the client.Holbein's portrait depicts a figure frozen in an official sense of responsibility. The simplicity of the shadowed background accentuates the increasing richness and boldness of design and adornment in Henrician court fashion, and the artist's skill is pre-eminent in creating the sheen and lustre of the precious stones. Great attention has been paid to the realism of the silver thread in the queen's dress, and this new opulence was to be echoed in the portrait of Henry himself.

07438-certosa.jpg	The exquisite painted decoration of the chapels of the church in the Certosa di San Martino, done both in fresco and in oils, was executed by prominent representatives of the younger Neapolitan school of painting, who were greatly influenced by Caravaggio. Of the works in fresco painting, the most outstanding example is the vault of the San Gennaro chapel, painted by Caracciolo in 1632 with four scenes from the life of the patron saint of Naples. His highly compressed compositions with their wealth of figures and drapery almost threaten to burst through the frames of the relatively small picture panel	CARACCIOLO, Giovanni Battista	Scenes from the Life of St Januarius	Fresco	1632	religious	Italian	1601-1650
07946-rest_f_e.jpg	"During his years in Rome, Annibale was an enthusiastic exponent of a cleansed classical art. He paid tribute to it in the amazing ceiling that he spent the last years of his life painting in the Palazzo Farnese. On this, and also on the large landscape lunettes in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Annibale was helped by young assistants, nearly all from Emilia, who subsequently established the classical style there that proved to be so successful. Annibale Carracci's reputation as an ""academic artist"" and the fact that for over three centuries he has been regarded as a paradigm of classical style, has meant that for too long we have overlooked his no less fascinating handling of nature, evident in his Landscape with the Flight into Egypt. But the melancholy which can be glimpsed in that landscape, whose symmetry almost anticipates Poussin's, overwhelmed Annibale as a man and he stopped painting toward the end of his life. Fortunately, his true place in art has been recognized by recent critical works"	CARRACCI, Annibale	Rest on Flight into Egypt	Oil on canvas, diameter 82,5 cm	c. 1604	religious	Italian	1551-1600
17072-paris22.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 363, JH 1351.The sitter in this portrait was the colour-merchant Tanguy, a Breton peasant who had settled in Paris and ran a small paint shop in the Rue Clauzel, much frequented by vanguard artists. His shop had become a kind of gallery of their paintings, for Tanguy would take paintings on deposit as credit for the painting materials he supplied. Van Gogh painted two portraits of Père Tanguy in the autumn and early winter of 1887, both against a background composed of Japanese colour woodcuts which he had begun to collect, firstly in Antwerp and then more avidly in Paris. Tanguy is placed massively in the centre of the canvas, facing the spectator. But the Paris merchant is presented not against an urban or even French setting, but in an imaginary context composed of Japanese seasonal scenes and costumed figures. Although this choice of background indicates van Gogh's evident preoccupation with Japanese prints - he also made individual copies of selected prints at this date - the painting does not indicate any profound influence of Japanese graphic styles or perspectival devices upon his work. But it is important to note that the motifs represented in the prints anticipate those that van Gogh would shortly resume when he left Paris and moved once again into a more rural setting - seasonal landscapes and portraits of regional types in costume.In his portraits of ordinary people van Gogh emphasized their sadness, dignity and kindness. The Portrait of Père Tanguy is a good example	GOGH, Vincent van	Portrait of P?re Tanguy	Oil on canvas, 92 x 75 cm	Autumn 1887, Paris	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
18320-1208grec.jpg	Painted for the high altar of the Colegio de Do&#241;a Maria, Madrid. The retable no longer exists, and the paintings are dispersed. The subjects of the paintings of the retable are not recorded, but it is assumed that they illustrated the Life of Christ. For reasons of size, style, and subject matter, the following paintings probably came from the retable: the Annunciation, the widest painting, in the centre (the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation); the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ, two paintings of the same size, on the left and right of the Annunciation; the Crucifixion above the Annunciation; and the Resurrection and Pentecost, another pair of identical size, flanking the Crucifixion (the whole forming a retable of a type known in the Escorial). Such an arrangement gives a chronological sequence to the events of the Life of Christ. The payment of 6000 ducados (for the paintings and retable) indicate a large commission. Small versions, probably models, exist for the three paintings more generally accepted as belonging to the retable, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ.Probably originally on the right of the retable of the Colegio de Do&#241;a María, balancing the Adoration of the Shepherds, and painted at the same time. A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome. A later development of this subject, only treated once before, in the Modena Triptych, is the painting for the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, Toledo, probably completed after his death by Jorge Manuel. The pose of the Christ is related to that of the Saint Sebastian of c. 1580. The bipartite composition can be related to the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, the portraits giving place to the range of angels. The splendid ecstatic figure of the angel, between the Baptist and Christ, is one of a number of such symbols that he began to introduce into his painting. If his figures - the actual participants in the action - become increasingly dematerialised, these new symbols appear as emotions materialised in gesture and colour	GRECO, El	The Baptism	Oil on canvas, 350 x 144 cm	1596-1600	religious	Spanish	1551-1600

35488-25mythol.jpg	The story, depicted in the painting is part of the legendary history of Athens and it has echoes of a primitive fertility rite. It tells how Vulcan, in a clumsy attempt to ravish Minerva, accidentally let his semen spill over the ground, and Mother Earth, thus fertilized, gave birth to Erichthonius. Minerva shut the infant in a basket, which she entrusted to the three daughters of Cecrops, king of Attica, forbidding them to open it. But one of them, overcome by curiosity, did so and discovered that the child had a serpent's tail for legs (or that a serpent lay beside it). Maddened with terror the three threw themselves from the top of the Acropolis. Erichthonius, brought up by Minerva, became king of Athens.The three sisters are depicted in the act of opening the basket, out of which a snake uncurls itself. The infant lies inside. Mother Earth is represented by a statue of Diana of Ephesus, the many-breasted goddess of fertility. The theme is most often found in 17th century Netherlandish painting	RUBENS, Peter Paul	The Discovery of the Child Erichthonius	Oil on canvas, 218 x 317 cm	c. 1615	mythological	Flemish	1601-1650
39766-11claris.jpg	Clarissa Strozzi was the daughter of Roberto Strozzi and Maddalena dei Medici, who lived in exile in Venice from 1540 to 1542. Along with the portrait of Ranuccio Farnese, this painting is the second enchanting child's portrait Titian painted in 1542. Clarissa is feeding her little dog, but, like Ranuccio, is looking at something taking place outside the picture. This again creates a vivid sense of movement.

00334-portra1.jpg	What strikes us in this portrait is the convincing compromise between the formal purity acquired from Bronzino, the predilection for enlarged forms drawn from Michelangelo, and the balanced, rhythmic spatial models of Raphael, for Allori was a truly skilled alchemist in combining these various influences in a dignified way.The lady portrayed is certainly Bianca Cappello, already painted by Allori in a fresco which now hangs in the Tribune of the Uffizi.On the back of the portrait is an allegorical scene, the Dream of Human Life	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on copper, 37 x 27 cm	1570-90	portrait	Italian	1551-1600
04775-landsca2.jpg	This painting is the pendant of the Landscape with a Fountain, also in the Hermitage. The two paintings demonstrate the artist's favourite compositional device, framing the scene with tall Roman pine trees that arch slightly inwards to shelter and provide shade for the figures below.

08877-0view1.jpg	Most of the frescoes in the transept of the upper church of San Francesco, as well as in the apse, were executed all at once by Cimabue and his workshop. Cimabue, who came from Florence, is the first of the mural painters active in Assisi who can be identified by name. The subject matter of the extensive pictorial program that was executed under Cimabue's direction in the transept and the apse is based for the most part on the dedications of the altars in the western section of the church. A thirteenth-century inscription indicates that the altar in the south transept was dedicated to the archangel Michael; the high altar, to the birth of the Virgin; and the altar in the north transept, to the apostles or to Peter and Paul. Accordingly, the apse had scenes from the life of the Virgin, culminating in the Assumption; the south transept had motifs from the Apocalypse and a large Crucifixion on the east wall; the north transept arm had scenes from the lives of the apostles and another large Crucifixion; and the crossing vault had the evangelists.The scenes from the life of the Virgin in the apse of the Upper Church represent the first large program dedicated to Mary in the history of Italian painting. The paintings of the upper registers are almost entirely destroyed. The four large fields of the basamento to the left and right of the papal throne are dedicated to the death and glorification of the Virgin. The Assembly of the Apostles by the Virgin's Deathbed is followed by the Death of the Virgin and the Assumption. The final painting, shown here, represents the Virgin as intercessor, sitting on the heavenly throne alongside Christ. They are flanked by angels, patriarchs, prophets, saints, and Franciscans.

12384-tobias.jpg	Karel Dujardin's classically styled biblical scenes, produced mostly in his Amsterdam period between 1659 and 1674, betray the influence of the schools of Rome and Bologna in general, and, on occasion, of Annibale Carracci in particular. The Old Testament story of Tobias became popular in seventeenth-century Dutch art, especially in Rembrandt's circle. One of the most commonly treated scenes was that in which the young Tobias, at the behest of his accompanying angel, caught from the River Tigris an enormous fish, whose gall he used to heal his blind father Tobit	DUJARDIN, Karel	Tobias and the Angel with the Fish	Oil on canvas, 85 x 65 cm	1664-65	religious	Dutch	1651-1700

32073-madonna.jpg	Pordenone's enormous artistic freedom compared to the main Venetian school is beautifully expressed in this altarpiece.

39299-01ceilin.jpg	"This oval painting is part of the ceiling decoration in the Sala dell'Albergo. After his arduous life of wanderings, narrated by the paintings in the neighbouring church, Roch finally reaches heaven, its angelic choirs, and the supreme vision ""face to face.""The spirit of Michelangelo, who had only recently died, seems to permeate this ceiling picture. While the figure of God the Father is reminiscent of the Creator in the frescos of the Sistine Chapel, his encounter with the rising St Roch suggests Titian's famous Assunta, the epoch-making altarpiece of 1516/18 in the nearby Frari church, showing the Assumption of the Virgin. The muscular figure of the saint, patron of the victims of the plague, and the attractive representatives of the nine choirs of angels, slightly reminiscent of Gothic cathedral sculpture, seem to stand on the edge of an opening in the roof itself.

05414-italian.jpg	Jan Both was one of the best known of the Dutch painters living in Italy for varying length of time in the 17th century (the so-called Italianates). They painted landscapes without depicting a specific topography and almost all their works are imaginary compositions. Both's painting - although includes a draughtsman - is no exception. It shows a waterfall and a small gorge overgrown with bushes and trees close to a country road with a bridge which has just been crossed by a travelling party consisting of a carriage drawn by two horses led by grooms. By the side of the road are three groups of two figures each, all wearing rather rustic garbs.Judging by their poses and the sheet of paper held by one of them they are artists surveying the countryside. Opening up on the right is a broad view of the Roman campagna.

But to the modern observer his own description of the picture, written shortly before it was ready for the 1825 Academy exhibition - 'calm &#38; exhilarating, fresh &#38; blowing' - applies more happily to the sketch; the greatest sufferer in the finished canvas is the sky, which has lost its bubbling clouds	CONSTABLE, John	The Leaping Horse	Oil on canvas, 142 x 187 cm	1825	landscape	English	1801-1850

11024-503david.jpg	David's first history painting in exile was an extremely original and disturbing interpretation of the late antique myth of Cupid and Psyche. It was painted for the wealthy Italian patron and connoisseur Count Giovanni Battista Sommariva and, although planned in Paris, it was only finished in Brussels in 1817.As related by the Roman writer Lucius Apuleius in The Golden Ass (late second century AD), Cupid, the god of love, fell in love with the beautiful Psyche and brought her to his palace, where he visited her every night without ever letting her see his face. But curiosity got the better of her, and one night Psyche looked at Cupid while he was asleep. Unfortunately a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp and awakened him, whereupon he abandoned her and the palace disappeared. From then on Psyche was condemned to wander the earth and perform impossible tasks in the vain hope of winning her lover back.Many other artists saw the lovers as innocent, tender and poetic, but David deliberately drew attention to the sexual aspect of the relationship. Normally Cupid was shown as a beautiful young man, but David depicted him as a grinning adolescent who seems proud of his recent conquest. A great contrast is set up between Cupid's coarse ruddy features and awkward angular limbs, and the pale, smooth and languid beauty of the sleeping Psyche. Unusually for David, the colours are bright and intense; in Brussels he looked at the colours used by Flemish Renaissance artists such as Jan van Eyck.

During the 1660s the level of snowfall increased significantly and two of the harshest winters were in 1662-63 and 1671-72. Dutch artists, among them Jacob van Ruisdael and Klaes Molenaer produced many winter landscape in this period. Molenaer's winter scenes are characterised by a great interest in the harmony and balance between the figures and their surroundings, more akin to the work of the Haarlem painter of the previous generation, Isack van Ostade, than the atmospheric landscapes of Jacob van Ruisdael.The landscape elements in the present scene are broadly repeated in other works by Molenaer.

In 1487, Bastiano Mainardi, a native of San Gimignano who was a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, painted on the north wall of the church (to the left  of the choir) a depiction of St Gemignanus seated on his bishop's throne. Three local notables kneel before the city's patron saint. Below this scene there is a painted monument, with an inscription explaining that Strambi is buried here.

31268-adoratio.jpg	This panel presents a number of compositional and symbolic peculiarities: St Joseph is represented in the background, visible in the middle through the door of the hut, grazing the ox and the donkey, usually depicted next to the Infant Jesus; angels playing long flutes take the place of the shepherds and Magi; the white bird on the beam of the roof (a dove?), perhaps an allusion to the Holy Spirit that descended to Mary. The Virgin's usual blue cloak is adorned with the star of the Byzantine tradition and behind her hangs a humble saddle. The Infant St John has significantly handed the cross, symbol of the Passion, to the child, who, as was common in Tuscan painting, is lying on a sheet and a sack. The figure of the Madonna, like those of the angels, fits in perfectly with the curved edge of the panel, perhaps painted to celebrate a birth, as was customary at the time. Tradition and innovation are fused in this painting, of which there is another version in the Hermitage, considered by some the original and by others a replica of the tondo in the Galleria Borghese	PIERO DI COSIMO	The Adoration of the Christ Child	Oil on wood, diameter 140 cm	1505	religious	Italian	1451-1500

08864-12peter.jpg	"The painting is from the church of Corpus Domini in Venice. It was commissioned by Benedetto Carloni in his woill of November 5, 1504. It is signed in Latin on the paper on the base: ""JOANIS BAPTISTA CIMA / CONEGLIAN(ENS)IS.""Cima must have been attracted at a very early age to Venice, where he was fascinated by the elder Bellini and Antonello da Messina. From them he acquired a pictorial repertory suited to his work on a provincial circuit, and like Montagna and Alvise Vivarini, he propagated their approach to painting on the mainland and in Emilia. His work, however, has richer colour and warmth, through the influence of Giorgione.This altarpiece shows Cima's typical mixture of the archaic and the modern. The impeccably harmonious fifteenth-century construction of architecture and figures is accompanied by a modern sunny atmosphere and a landscape steeped in luminous vapour.

40892-03tripty.jpg	An impression of Ghent panel painting in the shadow of the leading masters is provided by a number of works from religious institutions in the city that have been attributed to local workshops on stylistic grounds. There is, for instance, the Triptych with the Family of St Anne. This work prompted the coinage of the name 'The Master of the Family of St Anne', an anonymous artist to whom several other panels in Ghent have been attributed. The most clearly discernible influence in his work is that of Van der Goes' realism	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Triptych with the Family of St Anne	Oil on panel, 87,4 x 92,5 cm (centre), 87,3 x 37,1 cm (left), 87,4 x 39,2 cm (right)	1490s	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
42811-5braida.jpg	Framed by a concave aedicule with double Corinthian columns, this large painting adorns the high altar of the church, the reconstruction of which materially involved Veronese's patron Michele Sanmicheli in 1552. After the completion of the architecture of the high altar, i.e. soon after 1564, work started on the iconographically unconventional altarpiece under the influence of Tridentine reformist ideas. It omits the gruesome torture of the martyrdom, concentrating instead on the saint's moment of intercession. The central figure is incorporated in a group composition full of movement. The scene of the martyr's unclothing is exaggerated by the presence of the Madonna in a bank of clouds accompanied by Sts Peter, Paul and the cardinal virtues Faith, Hope and Charity	VERONESE, Paolo	Martyrdom of St George	Oil on canvas, 426 x 305 cm	c. 1564	religious	Italian	1551-1600

35717-ruined_c.jpg	Panoramic views of the flat plains in Holland are often said to be the most distinctive contribution of Dutch landscape painting. They differ from the 'world panorama' of earlier Flemish art by seemingly recording the momentary view of a single scene, rather than being composed of a collection of separate visual memories. Formally, they are characterized bb a low horizon line, implying a low viewpoint. Although Ruisdael, perhaps the greatest and the most versatile Dutch landscape specialist, did not invent this type of picture, he became one of its most distinguished practitioners.This painting may represent a view in Gooiland, a district to the east of Amsterdam; there are, however, at least four other, smaller landscapes by Ruisdael that show the same view or part of it with considerable variations, and it is clear that he was not attempting strict topographical accuracy. Despite the pretence of spontaneity, this work, like all landscape paintings of the time, is a synthetic product of the artist's studio.Its dominant feature is the sky, to which two thirds of the picture surface is devoted and which is also reflected in the water of the foreground. This is the real, moisture-laden sky of Holland billowing with clouds, the sun breaking sporadically through scattering shafts of light across the countryside - effects which Constable was later to emulate. Almost more remarkable than the truthful record of the shape, density and illumination of the clouds is the illusion that they are moving through space and over our heads (we tend to think that perspective does not govern cloudscapes, but these seem to taper towards the horizon and broaden at the upper edge of the painting). The long horizon too seems to extend beyond the frame, broken only by church spires and the tiny white sails of a windmill. But our sense of inhabiting the landscape is compromised by our viewpoint in relation to the foreground. By letting us look down into the bastion standing below the horizon line, the painter suggests that we are viewing it from some improbably high place, higher also than the shore on which the peasants graze their flock (both figures and animals were painted by Adriaen van der Velde, a division of labour quite common in Dutch landscapes). This implied detachment, however, strengthens the elegiac mood aroused by the sight of overgrown ruins, melancholy reminders of a distant and more heroic past	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church	Oil on canvas, 109 x 146 cm	1665-72	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

13403-15arnol.jpg	"""The Arnolfini Marriage"" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him"	EYCK, Jan van	Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife	Oil on oak, 82 x 60 cm	1434	portrait	Flemish	1401-1450

20083-11hooch.jpg	This painting, also titled as A Merry Company with Two Men and Two Women, is one of the first genre pictures by De Hooch in which the figures rise above the level of soldiers visiting inns and in which the setting makes tentative claims to gentility. De Hooch took the ideas from Anthonie Palamedesz and Jacob van Velsen in Delft and from many painters in other cities. The Visit  represents the domestication of a social theme that had earlier been set mostly in taverns and bordellos. In slightly later years De Hooch would depict more luxurious rooms and superficially more polite behaviour than he did in this key work of his early maturity	HOOCH, Pieter de	The Visit	Oil on wood, 68 x 58 cm	c. 1657	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

The anonymous painter is referred to as Monogrammist B of 1576, but he is perhaps identical with Joost de Beer (active 1550, d. before 1595 in Utrecht). He transformed Dürer's famous Adam and Eve engraving into a panel painting. He placed the Fall of Man scene into the centre of a paradise landscape. In the distant background the episode of Creation of Adam can be seen	UNKNOWN MASTER, Netherlandish	Paradise with the Creation of Adam and the Fall of Man	Gum tempera on wood, 70 x 94 cm	1576	religious	Netherlandish	1551-1600
10917-lamentat.jpg	This type of Piet&#224;, whether or not accompanied by other holy women, appears more than once in Gerard David's oeuvre and was adopted on various occasions by painters of his circle such as Adriaan Isenbrant or Ambrosius Benson. A model drawing may have existed in David's studio or perhaps there was another prototype by his hand which is now lost. On closer examination David seems here to have built on both Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling.The composition of the scene is a kind of reprise of Memling's Reins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges). Here too, the scene is set in front of a landscape with on the left buildings intended to represent Jerusalem and on the right a group of rocks which serves as a repoussoir. The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which he placed at Christ's disposal, has been hewn out of the rocks here. Wearing a turban and exotic clothing he stands in profile before the tombstone, while Nicodemus enters the tomb. With Memling it is a Roman sarcophagus which stands in front of the rock and which is being opened by Joseph and Nicodemus. The composition itself, with the body held almost upright under the armpits and the head nodding to one side, derives from the right wing of Hugo van der Goes' Lamentation diptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The figure of the Virgin placed parallel along Christ's body with her arm diagonally across it is an adaptation in reverse of the Virgin's posture in Van der Goes. The same is probably also the case with the position of the squatting Mary Magdalene. The St John, with his right knee and foot in frontal view, is also borrowed from Memling's Reins triptych. The spire in the landscape is probably intended to suggest Bruges' Our Lady's Church	DAVID, Gerard	Lamentation	Oil on oak panel, 39,4 x 31,7 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
07663-carlev08.jpg	The painting affords a view of the Serenissima's most characteristic quay: the Molo, with the columns of San Marco and San Todaro (or Teodoro) framing the entrance to the city. On the left stands the Ducal Palace, rendered in minute detail. The steep perspective in which the building is captured continues into the background along the Riva degli Schiavoni. Cast in contrasting light and truncated by the upper border of the image, the column of San Todaro dominates the scene. Between it and the column of San Marco the mast of a schooner appears in the background; it marks the central axis of the composition. Together with the large schooner on the right, the column of San Todaro to some extent counterbalances the buildings which occupy the left side. There is much activity both on the water and in the Square, where most of the figures are gathered in small groups.This view of the Molo and the Ducal Palace towards the east is highly unusual. Instead of depicting the Palace frontally, Carlevaris turned a quarter circle so that we look down the façade of the building towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a composition he also used in four later works. The vantage-point in all these works is from the loggia of the Library, directly opposite the Ducal Palace.Although the architecture dominates the composition, the artist paid close attention to the human figures. Drawn or painted studies for several of the macchiette have survived. Scenes of people and situations drawn from everyday life were introduced to Italy in the first half of the seventeenth century by Dutch painters active in Rome. In the course of the century the so-called Bamboccianti cast such everyday scenes with growing frequency against a &#151; sometimes identifiable &#151; urban background. One of these painters was Johannes Lingelbach, whose work seems to have inspired Carlevaris's vedute. The Venetian artist is thought to have spent some time in Rome, where he could have become familiar with Lingelbach's work.Carlevaris's town views are also deeply rooted in the Venetian tradition of depicting historic or festive events. His View of the Molo with the Ducal Palace, however, does not document a procession, reception or other festivity; rather, it subordinates the human figures to a portrayal of one part of the city in meticulous, topographically correct detail from an unorthodox point of view	CARLEVARIS, Luca	The Molo with the Ducal Palace	Oil on canvas, 70 x 118 cm	c. 1710	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

Wearing the ring symbolic of his new office, his lively right hand grasps the chair, while his left hand languidly holds a letter, likely alluding to Ludovico's duties as secretary of state.

43965-2tripti1.jpg	"The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier. Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck. It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier. Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background. This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or ""Chinese apple"", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors. Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the ""devotio moderna"". This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life. In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him. This is why the angel Gabriel appears before Mary dressed in an immaculate alb and magnificent brocade cope, as if he had come to celebrate mass, rather than deliver a message"	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	The Annunciation	Oil on oak panel, 86 x 93 cm	c. 1440	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

35820-ferrybo.jpg	With far-reaching stylistic similarities in their monochromatic, tonal treatment of the subject, Salomon van Ruysdael's river landscapes and those of Jan van Goyen from the 1630s are almost indistinguishable. However, around 1645 the first-named artist discovered the pictorial possibilities of the tree motif in compositions, through the work of his much more famous nephew Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael, in which this element plays a key role. This gave his variations on the theme a new impulse, and between 1645 and 1655 he painted a series of peaceful, limpid views with which he reached the summit of his art. With the cautious expansion of his palette and the more self confident style typical of these years, his work is also much more distinctively his own.The compositional structure to which this landscape owes its attractiveness is of a bold simplicity. A quarter of the way up the picture the horizontal axis intersects a vertical axis provided by the dark silhouette of a group of trees rising up on the opposite river bank. This divides the picture into two zones, of almost identical size, but in formal contrast to each other. In the left half each individual motif, under a highly atmospheric sky, bathes in an aura of lightness and weightlessness, contrasting with the right half, where mass and volume are piled up in the form of a farmstead, overshadowed by the tree group. Within this constellation even the ferry in the left foreground, laden low with a four-in-hand and a large number of passengers, appears like a fallen leaf carried along effortlessly by the river, the connecting feature stretching through this landscape.Within Salomon van Ruysdael's work, catalogued by Wolfgang Stechow, this painting represents an exception from his otherwise typical use of diagonals in his compositions. But whenever in later works he returns to this traditional pattern, this Ferryboat appears to have been a key work for the discovery of new waterside motifs, providing the viewer with variety and entertainment during his visual walk along never-ending river banks	RUYSDAEL, Salomon van	The Ferryboat	Oil on canvas, 91 x 130,5 cm	1647	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
27081-oyster_e.jpg	Mieris's work are marked by the exceptional thoroughness of details, an effective variety of textures, and a smooth manner of painting akin to that of enamel miniatures. The everyday subject has an obvious erotic subtext: the richly furnished interior and elegant attire mask the vice that is cultivated in this establishment dedicated to gratification. The gentleman offers oysters, a symbol of lust and base pleasures.

05008-findmose.jpg	This painting and The Feast of Dives (Accademia, Venice) are considered Bonifacio's masterpieces. He has used the subject as an excuse to paint an open-air holiday scene, in which the luxuriousness of the clothes melts into the opulent landscape dotted with little genre scenes. In overall decorative effect, the painting is much like a tapestry. Bonifacio's sources of inspiration include Titian and Dosso, with some influence from northern European painters.

44680-tribuna.jpg	The painting has become one of the most celebrated images of eighteenth-century taste. Zoffany shows a group of connoisseurs and members of the nobility admiring works of art in the Tribuna, the principal room of the Uffizi in Florence, which was the most famous gallery in the world during the eighteenth century. The Tribuna had been built by Francesco de' Medici in 1585-9 to a design by Bernardo Buontalenti as a showcase for the most precious items in the Medici collection. Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale. In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture. The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor. The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772. Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray. Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael. For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion. The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici. These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene. In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force. The attention to detail and texture involves not just the portraits, but also the copies after the works of art nearly all of which are identifiable. Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.

43243-elegant.jpg	In the magnificent gardens of a country palace a group of young and fashionable figures have assembled for a banquet beneath the trees. It is an early example of f&#234;te galantes painted in the Netherlands in the early seventeenth century that would prove hugely influential on Dutch painting, especially in Haarlem, for a generation or more. Esias van de Velde, Willem Buytewech and Dirck Hals, were, for example, all directly influenced by Vinckboons's examples	VINCKBOONS, David	Elegant Party in an Ornate Palace Garden	Oil on oak panel, 51 x 98 cm	1610s	genre	Flemish	1601-1650

33455-19oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 521.The story of David and Bathsheba is in the Bible (II Sam. 11 :2-17). One evening while he walked on the roof of his palace David saw below him a beautiful woman bathing. This was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite who was then away on service in David's army. In an act of seignorial arrogance he had her brought to the palace and made love to her. She became pregnant as a consequence. Later he wrote to Uriah's army commander saying, 'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle . . . that he may be smitten and die.' This indeed came about and David afterwards married Bathsheba. The child survived only a few days. David subsequently did penance.Bathsheba is usually depicted at her toilet in various states of nudity. Earlier Renaissance artists show her clothed and merely washing her hands or feet, helped by attendants. Sometimes a messenger is shown arriving with a letter, though the Bible does not record this detail. David's morally indefensible conduct did not deter the medieval Church from drawing a typological parallel: he prefigured Christ and Bathsheba the Church.Rembrandt's painting shows Bathsheba as she receives the message of King David summoning her. The sculpture-like position of the woman is inspired by antique reliefs	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Bathsheba at her Bath	Oil on canvas, 142 x 142 cm	1654	mythological	Dutch	1601-1650

39243-02creati.jpg	One of the major achievements of Tintoretto's early works is the series of canvases painted in about 1550 for the Sala dell'Albergo of the Scuola della Santissima Trinitá. And of these the Creation of the animals is certainly unique for the swirling rhythm of the composition. In a blaze of golden light, which does not entirely escape the darkness still partly enveloping the newly created earth God the Father is portrayed as if suspended in mid-air in the act of creation. The animals rush forward from behind him while the birds shoot across the sky and the fishes dart through the water like arrows from his hand. The dramatic wind-swept scene is furrowed by the profiles of the animals which cross the canvas in running lines, conveying with extraordinary concision and expressiveness the theme of the work.Like Pietro Aretino's novel on the subject of Genesis, Tintoretto's painting shows the unicorn (right). The alleged curative and decontaminating qualities of the narwhal tusk, an essential item in every Renaissance cabinet of curiosities, were regarded as proof of the existence of this fabulous creature. Exotic creatures like the ostrich walking on the shore were much admired as gifts from guests to the princely courts of northern Italy, and were portrayed in drawings or engravings. As a true Venetian, however, Tintoretto here devotes particular artistic skill to the fishes, including sturgeon, salmon and red mullet.Tintoretto's model for this composition was Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery, London); he adopted the flying divine figure as well as the setting.

35698-water_m.jpg	Besides the Bentheim Castle, another motif Ruisdael discovered on his trip to the Dutch-German border region was the water mill. The half-timbered overshot and undershot mills he favoured were found in the eastern provinces of the Netherlands and in the area near Bentheim. Of course, earlier artists included watermills in their pictures but he was the first to make them the principal theme of a painting. The subject became one of the specialities of his pupil Meindert Hobbema, and today, when we think of them, his paintings not Ruisdael's come to mind. But in judging their respective accomplishments it is helpful to recall that Ruisdael painted powerful ones, such as Two Water Mills and an Open Sluice, which impresses by the cohesion of its forms and clear daylight effect, before Hobbema held a brush in his hand	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Two Watermills and an Open Sluice	Oil on canvas	1653	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
44046-1diptych.jpg	The two small panels, representing the Madonna and St Catherine of Alexandria, respectively, probably formed a diptych.The busts of prophets on the outside of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck were the model for the bust of God the Father at the top of the left panel. The figures of Adam and Eve were from the same source. The picture is usually regarded as an early work by Rogier himself from the years 1432-35, but the figure of the Madonna is probably after Jan van Eyck's Madonna of the Fountain, dated 1439, in Antwerp.The right panel is rather weaker, and is not by the same painter as the Madonna. As a king's daughter, Catherine has a crown, but she has taken it off, perhaps a sign of humility and reverence before the Madonna, and has placed it on the ground to lie there ignored. The wheel, her attribute, refers to the failure of the attempt to break her on the wheel; the martyr was finally beheaded with a sword	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Diptych	Oil on oak panel, 18,5 x 12 cm (each)	c. 1440	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

31738-01figure.jpg	Pissarro's landscapes include the people who live and work there; unlike his Impressionist friends Monet and Renoir, these are not city people who travel to the country to relax on the weekend, but peasant farmers and their wives, herdsmen, and shepherdesses.

19686-westerke.jpg	The works of Jan van der Heyden, one of the finest city-view specialists, are responsible for our general impressions of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite.Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building.Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal	HEYDEN, Jan van der	View of the Westerkerk, Amsterdam	Oil on panel, 41 x 59 cm	1670s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
03766-031madon.jpg	"Of all the still youthful Madonnas by Bellini the masterpiece is the so called Greek Madonna of the Brera Gallery in Milan, which entered the Museum in 1808 following the Napoleonic repression. It was originally in the Ducal Palace in Venice. According to some sources the figures were originally set against a gold background, on which the words ""Mother of God"" and ""Christ"" were written in Greek (hence the name of the painting). Obviously, a background of this type would have made it archaic and ""archaizing"", considerably accentuating the Byzantine appearance of the panel, a veritable Marian icon. The 1986 restoration has established that the still remaining traces of gold beside the Greek letters were a 16th-century addition, while Bellini had originally conceived the sky as it appears now: blue and almost entirely covered by a small curtain held up by a cord. Over the traditional preparatory ground (gypsum and animal glue) he had sketched out the preliminary drawing, marking in with extreme precision even the chiaroscuro with subtle and highly regular criss-cross strokes which can be seen in infra-red photography. This technique used by Bellini must have been famous if Paolo Pino in his Dialogo di pittura (1548) writes that ""drawing the painting with such extreme diligence, composing it with chiaro and scuro as Giovanni Bellino was wont to do"" was to be discouraged ""for it is work thrown away since everything must be covered with the colours"".This type of drawing shows similarities with the rigorous Flemish constructive technique, though under closer scrutiny it appears to be aimed at a search for a much more solid and volumetrically constructed plastic quality. The delicate imperturbability of the Madonna, which would always remain a distinctive feature of Bellini's Virgins, shows not only its aforementioned Byzantine-iconic roots, but also how much the artist's culture owes to this heritage"	BELLINI, Giovanni	Madonna with the Child (Greek Madonna)	Tempera on wood, 82 x 62 cm	1460-64	religious	Italian	1451-1500

09530-selfport.jpg	Occasionally a painting contains extra information, about the scene itself, for example, or about the artist. This self-portrait by the Amsterdam painter Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen tells us important facts about his life. The note with the date 1533 and the house mark between an I and an A appear to announce that Iacobus Amstelodamensis, or Jacob of Amsterdam, painted this portrait of himself in 1533. It is known from the archives that Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, the person behind the name Jacob of Amsterdam, must have died before 18 October 1533, the date of a document stating that his wife was a widow. That and the date on the Self-Portrait appear to be conclusive evidence that the artist did indeed die that year.However, it has been suggested that he was dead by 1532, when one of his houses was sold. So 1533 or 1532 - it is not known for sure. On top of that, there are doubts about when the Self-portrait was actually executed. It is very close in style to the paintings that Jacob Cornelisz made around 1525, and he is not known to have made any more after 1526. It is possible that the date was added later, in the year of his death, and that we are looking at a Van Oostsanen who is younger than he appeared in 1533.There is another panel in which the same man is seated before an easel, painting the portrait of an older woman. It is by Dirck Jacobsz, the couple's son, who traced the head in the Rijksmuseum Self-Portrait and used it for the man by the easel. He then added his mother's likeness, creating an anachronistic scene: a portrait of his father as he probably looked before 1533, and one of his mother as she appeared around 1550	CORNELISZ VAN OOSTSANEN, Jacob	Self-Portrait	Oil on panel, 38 x 30 cm	1533	portrait	Netherlandish	1501-1550

07264-canal714.jpg	The Royal Hospital at Greenwich was completed in 1752, over half a century after it was begun. Canaletto painted this depiction of it soon afterwards. It shows the view, which has altered little, through the centre of the hospital complex to the Queen's House, and on towards the Royal Observatory at the top of the hill beyond.Canaletto has created a slightly 'wide angle' effect by combining what can be seen of the hospital from two separate viewpoints which are set a little way apart on the near side of the Thames. He has slightly broken the potential symmetry of the composition by studying the buildings from a little left of centre. In addition, the monotony of the river is relieved by the considerable variety of craft that is travelling up and down it, and also by the unrelenting verticals and horizontals of the design which are countered by the bold diagonal of the mast of the ship grounded at the right.The river and architecture were established first by the artist, and the boats then painted over the top; it is just possible to see the buildings through the sails of the boat to the left of the centre of the picture	CANALETTO	London: Greenwich Hospital from the North Bank of the Thames	Oil on canvas, 66 x 112,5 cm	c. 1753	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

39579-12cherry.jpg	In this half-length picture of the Madonna, Titian was still keeping entirely to a pictorial idiom typical of Giovanni Bellini.

43703-selfport.jpg	This self-portrait shows the artist sitting at his easel pointing to a painting that he has just completed. The painting of the nude on his easel is probably a representation of 'sight' from the traditional series of the five senses, explaining the little hand-mirror - and, of course, the unseen mirror into which Waitt himself looks. Or perhaps the woman, who gazes towards the artist rather than her mirror, symbolises the art of portraiture itself	WAITT, Richard	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas, 107 x 127 cm	1728	portrait	Scottish	1701-1750

28483-winter_l.jpg	Momper is rightly regarded as the most important Flemish landscape painter between Pieter Brueghel and Rubens. Brueghel's influence is clearly evident in this winter landscape, and it is quite probable that his son Jan also painted a number of the figures in this picture.Momper's personal achievement lies in his rendering of landscape as a picturesque subject matter in its own right. What we see here is no longer a great universal landscape full of symbolically charged allusions, but a scene whose aesthetic appeal is valued for its own sake. Momper's painting is divided into various planes by a kind of backdrop, against which silhouettes are highlighted by a pale light or dark, thundery clouds. People are making their way along tortuous paths on terrain that seems to be hazardous.Rain-laden stormclouds, sunshine and snow set the atmosphere of the painting. In this respect, Momper has taken an important step towards emancipating the landscape painting as an autonomous genre in which the landscape is not merely a setting for some event, but is treated as a subject matter in its own right	MOMPER, Joos de	Winter landscape	Oil on panel, 49,5 x 82,5 cm	c. 1620	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
23471-pyrrhus.jpg	"Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, took Andromache, wife of Hector, as part of his spoils from the Trojan War and had three sons by her. One of these sons became king of Epirus after Pyrrhus' death.Pyrrhus and Andromache are characters in the tragedy ""Andromaque"" written in 1667 by Jean Racine (1639-1699), a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France (along with Molière and Corneille), and an important literary figure in the Western tradition."

13439-alfieri.jpg	"Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803)was an Italian tragic poet whose predominant theme was the overthrow of tyranny.To glorify the personality of this writer of tragedies, Fabre has clearly added to the faithfulness of the portrait a heroic tone, evident in the facial expression and the pose of the raised arm over which the brown mantle is slung all'antica.Beyond its value as a historical document, the work is also a striking example of the more severely classicistic current which emerged from the school of David, of whom Fabre was a pupil and close follower.The painting is signed and dated in the lower right corner, ""F. X. Fabre Florentia 1793"", and on the reverse bears a famous sonnet written by the poet, dated 18 August 1794"	FABRE, François-Xavier	Portrait of Vittorio Alfieri	Oil on canvas, 93 x 73 cm	1793	portrait	French	1751-1800

07331-limbo.jpg	From 1640 on, Cano's technique became increasingly pictorial, that is to say, increasingly Baroque, acquiring some of the subtleties he had previously ignored. Perhaps his most important painting is the Descent into Limbo (in the County Museum, Los Angeles), a strange, rather illustrative composition, anecdotal in the movement imparted to the figures, but including one of the rare, and one of the most beautiful female nudes in Spanish art	CANO, Alonso	Descent into Limbo	Oil on canvas, 169 x 121 cm	c. 1640	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

24243-view2.jpg	The painting represents a capriccio of an imagined cityscape with Saint Mark's Basilica and ruins on the banks of a river. This imagined riverside town is typical of the spirited and picturesque landscapes created early in the career of Michele Marieschi. The artist includes celebrated and instantly recognizable edifices, such as Venice's Saint Mark's Basilica here, and places them side by side with fantasy buildings and crumbling ruins.  The artist is not bound by rules of perspective: the ruined columns and the tower overgrown with greenery are painted to a completely different scale than the houses directly opposite them on the other side of the river at right. They dwarf the figures beneath them, who cross the bridge between the two sides	MARIESCHI, Michele	Capriccio of a Riverside Town	Oil on canvas, 51 x 75 cm	c. 1735	landscape	Italian	1701-1750
37076-8decora3.jpg	"The picture shows the wainscoting to the right of the entry. In the tondo a young man wearing turban, identified as Empedocles, a Greek philosopher (c. 490-430 BC), leans out of the window to watch the Apocalypse. On a small tablet set in among the grotesques, the painter's initials ""LS"" can be seen.If we look carefully at the anthropomorphic decorations, crowded with naked bodies in an incredible variety of poses, or the convulsive violence (that Scarpellini has compared to action painting) that runs through some of the foliage patterns or the groups of tritons and naiads like an electric current, we can really begin to understand Signorelli's great ability as a draughtsman, a talent that is further confirmed by his drawing production"	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Empedocles	Fresco, width 190 cm	1499-1502	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

02892-il_gesu2.jpg	The picture shows the cupola, pendentives, transept vault, and antechoir of the church of Il Ges&#249; in Rome.In Baroque churches, in addition to the choir, the nave vaults, transept chapels, and cupola (if present) offered large and attractive surfaces for painting. Although fictive openings in ceilings and vaults had already been created in painting in the sixteenth century, permitting vivid views of events taking place in heaven, the heavenly visions of the seventeenth century take on a new quality, scale, and intensity. The supreme example is the ceiling composition executed by Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Il Ges&#249;, the most spectacular of a fresco program encompassing virtually the entire church that Baciccio worked on for thirteen years (1672-85). In earlier examples the architecture served as the framing for the pictures, in Il Ges&#249; the relationship between architecture and painting was redefined: painting and decoration are confined to those portions of the church structure of greatest symbolic importance	BACICCIO	Cupola decoration	Fresco	1676-79	religious	Italian	1651-1700

36075-5window.jpg	Vasari points out that Salviati, in addition to his   work on the narrative frescoes, also executed some of the decorative details - the window framing between his two scenes, but also the illusionistic window to the right of the Birth of St John the Baptist scene. These window framings, with their nude youths atop festoons of fruit, are primarily decorative displays of artistic virtuosity; at the same time they contain elements - for example the tondo with the chiaroscuro depiction of Time revealing Truth - that can likewise easily be seen as referring to the theological content of the frescoes as well as to the work of the confraternity	SALVIATI, Cecchino del	Illusionistic window	Fresco	1536-53	religious	Italian	1501-1550

23780-whaleoil.jpg	In the first half of the seventeenth century, Jan Mayen Island and Spitsbergen were used as whaling bases by the Noordse Compagnie (Dutch Northern Company). This painting shows the company settlement on Jan Mayen Island, with the snow-clad peak known as Beerenberg in the background. In the foreground we can see the whale-oil factory in operation. On the left, a whale is being 'flensed'. On the right, the strips of blubber are being chopped up on wooden tables and boiled in huge vats.

33936-aurora.jpg	During Guido Reni's second stay in Rome he directly tackled themes from classical Antiquity. While this composition was openly derived from classical art, it was meant in the spirit of purest love and has a genuine if rather insipid beauty.Though a ceiling decoration, it is composed in the form of a frieze as if painted on a wall. Here the artist was rebelling against the spatial researches which at that time were exciting such passionate interest in Lanfranco and Pietro da Cortona	RENI, Guido	Aurora	Fresco	1614	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
37933-celtwin.jpg	Even the ritual of the lying-in visit, associated with childbirth, was not spared Steen's parodying brush. In the Twin Birth Celebration he depicts a hilarious and witty scene of a flustered elderly father who is mocked by a throng of clamorous women as he receives his newborn twins. Steen's old man must be impotent &#151; since common wisdom held that the aged were infertile &#151; and therefore completely incapable of having sired one infant, let alone two. A younger, virile man must have fathered them as the old fool, much to his consternation, has suddenly realized	STEEN, Jan	Twin Birth Celebration	Oil on canvas, 69 x 79 cm	1668	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
34358-giudecc.jpg	The most original paintings by the Swedish artist depict the Venetian lagoons enlivened by boats. The architecture is represented down to the smallest detail.

In this example the Virgin-and-Child group is expanded into a Holy Family with the foster father Joseph. The Christ Child stands upright on the stone parapet, lovingly embraced by the Virgin.

26380-puddlers.jpg	Meunier found his main subject in about 1880: man at work. from 1885, he also turned to this particular subject in his sculpting. The title of this relief is a reference to the puddling and Krupp burning process used in iron-making. Only a small area of the blast furnace, the actual place of work, is shown on the right-hand edge of this relief. The middle one of the three labourers is one of the most impressive to be seen in any of Meunier's works. His right foot is pressed against the furnace, his torso is stretching backwards. Every muscle, every sinew is tensed as he works the iron with all his strength.Meunier's labourers are types rather than individual people and are idealised.

39286-1mark.jpg	The painting is the first of a series of works, painted in 1548 for the Scuola Grande di San Marco while Marco Episcopi, his future father-in-law was Grand Guardian of the School.The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearence of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of the saint against his master's will. The scenes takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light, while the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.In keeping with the drama of the action is the tight construction of the painting, the dramatic fore-shortening of the forms and sudden strong contrast of light and shade	TINTORETTO	The Miracle of St Mark Freeing the Slave	Oil on canvas, 415 x 541 cm	1548	religious	Italian	1551-1600

The eagle which is to devour his liver every day - Prometheus' punishment for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mankind - is hovering ominously in a corner.

The hat band which is casually draped across his shoulder provides an artistic frame for the young man's face.The sitter of the portrait is probably Gianlorenzo de' Medici, and it could very well be Botticelli's first commissioned work, and from the hair and the clothes, the portrait must date from no later than 1469	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Portrait of a Young Man	Tempera on panel, 51 x 33,7 cm	c. 1469	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

35734-water_fx.jpg	Ruisdael never visited Scandinavia, but he borrowed the idea of Norwegian landscapes from Allaert van Everdingen, an artist who worked for a time in Haarlem and had success with such works. A rush of water carrying away a broken tree, a house huddled on a slope, and tiny figures beneath a clouded sky - all these components make it possible to see the painting as a piece of 17th-century speculation on the romantic opposition of man and the elements	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Waterfall in Norway	Oil on canvas, 108 x 143 cm	1668-72	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

Three shady characters, their faces hidden or turned away, are pulling, dragging and pushing the cross to which Peter has been nailed by the feet with his head down.Caravaggio's St Peter is not a heroic martyr, nor a Herculean hero in the manner of Michelangelo, but an old man suffering pain and in fear of death. The scene, set on some stony field, is grim. The dark, impenetrable background draws the spectator's gaze back again to the sharply illuminated figures who remind us, through the banal ugliness of their actions and movements - note the yellow rear and filthy feet of the lower figure - that the death of the apostle was not a heroic drama, but a wretched and humiliating execution	CARAVAGGIO	The Crucifixion of Saint Peter	Oil on canvas, 230 x 175 cm	1600-01	religious	Italian	1551-1600

14668-2refecto.jpg	Taddeo Gaddi was Giotto's most important student, belonging to his workshop for twenty-four years. He produced a number of frescoes in Florence and Pisa, besides numerous panel paintings, but until his death in 1366 he was mainly active in Santa Croce, the Franciscan monastery in Florence, and his house and workshop were nearby. His late works, from around 1360, include the fresco of the Crucifixion in the sacristy and the ensemble of paintings grouped around a Tree of Life (Arbor vitae) in the refectory of Santa Croce.The picture shows the interior of the refectory in Santa Croce in Florence. The frescoes were commissioned by the woman in the garments of a Franciscan tertiary kneeling at the foot of the cross, behind St Francis.

26719-lu10rob.jpg	"""Solomon begat Rehoboam. Rehoboam begat Abijah. Abijah begat Asa."" (Matthew 1:7)Astonishing naturalness and a large variety of poses characterize the figures in the last lunettes, which are known to have been painted with great rapidity.On the left a woman is depicted in profile; she sits alone, gazing out into the chapel, leaning backward with her elbow on the back of the seat. This is a detail that is only found here, and it may be compared to the low step on which, on the other side of the lunette, the sleeping young man rests a foot. The woman's right arm and hand are stretched out on her leg, while her left hand points to the unborn child she is carrying in her womb.The young man at right is seated bent forward in an attitude of complete abandon. His head, with his face turned toward the wall, is resting on the hand placed on his right knee; his other arm hangs down at his side. Behind him, a young boy seems to be trying to make him sit upright by grabbing his shoulder. The juxtapositions of bright colours in the woman's clothes - a green scarf over her head and shoulders, a violet-rose pinafore, a reddish-orange mantle with yellow ocher lining - are matched by equally rich, but more delicate, tones in those of the young man"	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Rehoboam - Abijah	Fresco, 215 x 430 cm	1511-12	religious	Italian	1501-1550
38614-revelle1.jpg	The picture shows a countryside inn with revellers enjoying an afternoon's drinking, the innkeeper chopping wood in the foreground, and a pastoral landscape beyond.

26062-17rein.jpg	This small triptych is the second altarpiece to be commissioned from Memling by a brother at St John's Hospital in Bruges, the first being the Floreins triptych. The donor has been identified as Adriaan Reins on the basis of the initials AR on the frame and the figure of St Adrian who protects him in the left wing. Reins was received into the Order in 1479, and died in 1490.The principal scene is a Lamentation on Golgotha beneath a glowering evening sky. The left wing represents the donor with his patron saint, while the right wing features St Barbara, the hospital saint par excellence.The composition is a development on an idea of Rogier van der Weyden, who was the first to reduce the Lamentation to its three principal protagonists (apart from Christ) in a number of smaller compositions. The body with its stiff, open arms and closed legs, knelt over by the praying Virgin, first appears in another work by the same master, namely the Lamentation in The Hague (Mauritshuis). The scene as a whole is portrayed in deep and sombre tones. The predominance of purple - including the marbling of the frame - means that the altarpiece is literally enveloped in the colour of the Passion.Two versions of this Lamentation are known: the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych in Rotterdam and the Rome Lamentation, both of which were probably painted at an earlier date. The former in particular may be seen as the immediate compositional predecessor of the Reins triptych.Doubts as to the authorship of the work were expressed from an early stage, probably because the figures of St John and Mary Magdalene did not meet the idealised Memling image that had been formed by the nineteenth century, and because of the lack of an inscription with the artist's signature. Despite these doubts, this little triptych is a masterpiece, executed with the utmost delicacy.The central panel was partially copied (landscape, Christ and St John) in the Santa Barbara Lamentation by a follower of Memling from the late fifteenth century	MEMLING, Hans	Triptych of Adriaan Reins	Oil on oak panel, 43,8 x 35,8 cm (central panel), 45,3 x 15,3 cm (each wing)	1480	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

12113-children.jpg	Although Drouais made his career primarily as a society portrait painter in the tradition of Largillière and Nattier, his portraits 'déguisés' were very different from theirs. Instead of court ladies depicted in the guise of antique goddesses, Drouais chose to depict his ladies and gentlemen (and especially their children) in pastoral guises (say, of shepherds and shepherdesses) or as members of different, perhaps less fortunate classes such as harvest workers or Savoyards. The present portrait depicts the two sons of the Duc de Bouillon dressed as Montagnards. One holds a marmot with a ribbon and the other plays a hurdy-gurdy, both activities associated exclusively with the people of the mountains especially in Savoy and in North Italy.The painting is signed lower centre: Drouais le fils 1756	DROUAIS, François-Hubert	The Children of the Duc de Bouillon	Oil on canvas, 86 x 130 cm	1756	genre	French	1701-1750

He holds out his arm toward that of the Lord, who, borne aloft amidst a flight of angels, stands out brightly against the shell of shadow of his huge purple mantle.

08420-figures.jpg	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene (see at Angeluccio) and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone"	CERQUOZZI, Michelangelo	Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue	Oil on canvas, 130 x 97 cm	1640s	landscape	Italian	1601-1650
19371-5hayez.jpg	"The painting is also known as Meditation on the Old and New Testaments.The darkened glance of the beauty in this painting is not really directed at the viewer. She is sunk in thought, looking out of the canvas in a pre-occupied way. In her right hand she holds a folio bearing the words ""Storia d'Italia"", this is to say a symbol of knowledge. Her left hand holds the symbol of faith, the Cross, that has played so great a part in Italy's history. Her naked breast is highly provocative when seen with the black cross of mourning. She is perhaps the allegory of Italy in the 19th century, and the gaze with which this figure of ""Italia"" confronts the viewer creates a suggestive, almost hypnotic effect. She seems to be in a state between waking and dreaming. This is meditation that has not yet reached a solution, meditation in which grief predominates"	HAYEZ, Francesco	Meditation on the History of Italy	Oil on canvas, 90 x 70 cm	1850	portrait	Italian	1801-1850
35473-11mythol.jpg	Venus and her son Cupid are being offered food and wine by Ceres, goddess of the fruits of the field, and Bacchus, god of wine. The subject comes from a line by the Roman comic poet Terence (d. 159 BC) which frequently figures in the emblem literature that developed from the mid-16th century: 'Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus' - without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus would freeze. Love is impossible without food and drink. Rather than depicting a boisterous feast, Rubens has opted for a rather restrained scene that must be read as a plea for moderation in pleasure.Rubens produced this painting a few years after his eight-year stay in Italy, where he was employed at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, and also in Rome. The knowledge of antiquity he gained then was put to use in this painting, as also in a later work on the same theme in 1614, (Royal Fine Arts Museum, Antwerp), Ceres' pose being taken from the Crouching Venus of the Hellenistic sculptor Doidalsas, dating from around 240-230 BC. Rubens certainly knew the marble copy in the Farnese collection in Rome (today in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples).What he particularly appreciated in Hellenistic and Roman sculpture was its formal dynamism, although he saw in ancient sculpture generally a realm of flawless, ideal nature. In painting from such antique models, he says in his De Imitatione Statuarum, a treatise 'on the imitation of sculpture', the statuary has to be humanised, translated into flesh and blood.

24925-metropo2.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine	MASTER of the Acts of Mercy	Giving Drink to the Thirsty (exterior)	Oil on fir panel, 74 x 47 cm	1460s	religious	Austrian	1451-1500

17065-paris15.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 313, JH 1251.This picture shows an inviting restaurant in Asnières. Van Gogh's unique facility for communicating his feelings directly by means of his brushwork is already in evidence. The light and the associated atmospheric effects have become the actual subject of the picture, very much in the spirit of the Impressionists. Although still restrained, the painting is defined in terms of colour by contrasting complementary colours: blue and orange, red and green.By the middle of 1887 a dramatic change of style has occurred in van Gogh's work. Using these characteristically 'impressionist' motifs of a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, van Gogh seems to have been willing to experiment with Impressionist techniques as well. However, the painting lacks a sense of substance and conviction, which reflects his difficulty in feeling himself as part of the world he is portraying.In the two years van Gogh spent in Paris he tried to assimilate French Impressionism, only to find that a new generation of painters were questioning its premises regarding both subject-matter and style. His flirtation with Impressionist subject-matter was brief; encounters with the Neo-Impressionists led him to believe that Paris could no longer be the subject of modern French painting	GOGH, Vincent van	Restaurant de la Sir?ne at Asni?res	Oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm	Summer 1887, Paris	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
35316-sketch1.jpg	This painting is an oil sketch (modello) for the principal altarpiece in the east transept of the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg, built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) between 1696 and 1707. This altarpiece is one of the most important works from Rottmayr's later period. The modello is a smaller version of the six-meter high altarpiece and reproduces the elongation and distortion of the figures which create the perspective of the altarpiece itself.St Charles Borromeo was the intercessor for people stricken with the plague. In response to an outbreak of the plague epidemic in the city of Salzburg, processions are held and Holy Communion is administered following the example of St Charles Borromeo. Rottmayr defined the location of the event by depicting recognisable features of the Salzburg landscape and architecture.Rottmayr's style of painting was shaped by and bears the imprint of his schooling in the Italian, and above all Venetian, art of painting in the sixteenth century	ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael	Apotheosis of St Charles Borromeo	Oil on canvas, 130 x 58 cm	c. 1721	religious	Austrian	1701-1750
24307-10marko.jpg	Markó often interrupted his stay in Italy for the sake of paying a visit to Hungary. This work, made in 1853, is considered a rarity, because, except for a few works during the earliest period of his career, he never painted Hungarian landscapes. Although his art can largely be classified as late neo-classicist, this time Markó chose a romantic motif. He depicted the Puszta, the region of the country which is still thought to be the most special and the most interesting, with a sweep-pole well, its mandatory symbol. A rainbow glows in the stormy sky. One is reminded of the anxiety felt before a storm by the ponderous, dark clouds. Besides the subject of the painting, its style also shows the traits of romanticism, with special regards to its composition which is built on the contrast between light and dark.

14015-1zenob01.jpg	The Villa Zenobio in Santa Bona Nuova, near Treviso, was built between 1673 and 1689 and was profoundly reworked during the mid-eighteenth century when the garden wing was erected. The small entrance portego was decorated in the early years of the eighteenth century by Gregorio Lazzarini. In 1744, the villa was acquired by Sebastiano Uccelli (1695-1768) who can be credited with the renovation of the villa. He commissioned Francesco Fontebasso to paint frescoes in the ballroom of the new garden wing.Frescoes unfold across the ceiling and walls of the vast ballroom, as well as beneath the open gallery. The ceiling fresco depicts The Magnanimity of Scipio, while the wall frescoes focus on the narration of episodes from the life of Queen Zenobia and represent The Banquet of Zenobia and Triumph of Aureliano. However, the interpretation of these scenes is debated	FONTEBASSO, Francesco	View of the ballroom	Fresco	1745-50	interior	Italian	1701-1750
23081-6roadto.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church.This scene has the tragic cadence of a procession of Flagellants, like the ones used to travel along the roads of Umbria on Good Friday, accompanied by the singing of lauds and marching to the rhythm of their scourges	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Road to Calvary	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350
40266-organ_2.jpg	In 1469 the cover of the organ of the Cathedral in Ferrara was painted by Tura. The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. The shutters were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.Light is effectively rendered as an expressive device without becoming a particularly naturalistic component, striking here and there, helter-skelter, although a certain concentration on the left may be isolated. Highlights are also found on the right-hand edges of forms, especially in the canvas showing St George impaling the dragon. Color is equally antinaturalistic. The tight-fitting leather costume of the saint is outlined, pale maroon against a golden sky. His gray horse, ferociously participating in the confrontation, is accentuated by a calligraphic arrangement of thin red straps. There are strong echoes of Mantegna, perhaps in part filtered through Squarcione, in motives like the rendering of the winding trail with figures on the hill behind the princess and a tight application of paint, which permits abundant minuscule detail. Critics have called attention to connections with later Donatello, especially with his reliefs made for nearby Padua. These are difficult to isolate within the personal expressive idiom of the St George, except for the shared intensity in treating sacred figures and narratives	TURA, Cosm?

12298-21badia.jpg	Painted with the 'Master of the Badia at Isola'. With regard to this anonymous master it is worth recording that in all probability he was at the beginning in such close relations with Duccio as to lend credibility to the opinion that Duccio's hand can be detected in some of his early works. As an example can be cited the very beautiful Madonna no. 593 in the Pinacoteca of Siena whose face is really so close to Duccio's Crevole Madonna that it could easily be attributed to him and dated to that period	DUCCIO di Buoninsegna	Madonna and Child (no. 593)	Tempera on wood, 63 x 49,5 cm	1280s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08528-1lands02.jpg	Cézanne's main work was done in landscapes. He painted the river valleys of the Ile-de-France and, above all, his beloved hard, bright, sunbaked Provence.

A magnificent garland of meticulously painted flowers and fruits reflecting the diversity of nature frames the idyllic scene like a triumphal arch. It forms the letter M for Mary, who is seated as in a ""beszlozzenen garten"" or hortus conclusus dominating the middle ground with the Christ child on her knee. Beside her are the angels and the lamb, slightly behind her is Joseph and in the background is a view of a landscape with grazing deer.

18091-1orsini.jpg	"This little panel was part of a predella from an altarpiece of the Madonna, Angels and Saints, which was commissioned by the Confraternity of the Purification of the Virgin, in Florence. On October 23, 1461, the contract for the painting was drawn up. It is a remarkable document in the number and precision of its stipulations and instructions. The painter was asked to use Fra Angelico's altarpiece at San Marco as a model and to execute the entire work by his own hand, with the greatest care. One clause stated that ""...the said painting must go beyond all the good painting done up to now by the said Benozzo, or at least should be comparable in quality...""The artist scrupulously observed the conditions of the contract. His composition is clearly articulated, with the initial episode of the narrative placed in the middle ground.

41899-cafaggi.jpg	The picture showing the Villa Medicea at Cafaggiolo is one of the 14 paintings in lunette form which represent the Medici villas. They were made by artist in 1599-1602 for the third grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I.The Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo was one of the oldest and most favoured of the Medici family estates. The villa was reconstructed following designs of the architect Michelozzo in 1452, becoming a meeting place for some of the greatest intellectuals of the Italian Renaissance. The Medici visited it often: as a consequence, the villa was the scene of many momentous events in the history of the dynasty, ranging from the reception of Medici brides to the murder of a Medici wife	UTENS, Giusto	Villa Medicea, Cafaggiolo	Fresco	1599	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
25276-05educat.jpg	The Golden Legend, drawing on the apocryphal gospels, tells how the Virgin Mary was brought up as a child in the Temple at Jerusalem 'with other virgins'...and was visited daily of angels', since it had been foretold to her parents, Joachim and Anne, that their daughter was to be consecrated to the Lord as the 'chosen vessel' of Christ's Incarnation. The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character. Mary is seen in earlier examples teaching her young companions, sewing the priest vestments or being ministered to by angels who bring bread and water. But the favourite theme, especially in Counter-Reformation art, depicts her education in the strict sense, at the knee of her mother Anne, learning to read.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art	MAULBERTSCH, Franz Anton	The Education of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 60 x 30 cm	c. 1755	religious	Austrian	1751-1800

Formerly attributed to Van der Weyden and the Master of the Legend of St Catherine, it came to be regarded as a Bruges work by most art historians who expressed a view about it	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Nativity	Oil on oak panel, 35,8 x 30,5 cm	1475-1500	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

18487-selfport.jpg	Greuze was in his late 50s when he conceived of this portrait of himself. It was a difficult period for him personally, because his notoriously difficult marriage was finally coming apart, but at the same time he was painting some of his most important genre pictures. In these he created scenes from contemporary life that combined an unblinkered view of the world around him with a style derived from the grand manner of the traditional historical painter. His penetrating insight into his subjects' motivation and personality is also evident in the portraits and self-portraits of which he made many at this time.

08797-eligius.jpg	St Eligius, who was born c. 590 in Limousin, notably in the making of reliquaries has become one of the most popular saints of the Christian West. Ancient tradition credits him with extraordinary talent as a goldsmith.St Eligius in His Workshop remains to this day the best-known and best-loved painting of Petrus Christus. It shows two young fiancés who have brought the patron saint of goldsmiths a quantity of precious metal to be melted down and fashioned into rings as token of their love. Christus gives us an extremely detailed representation of the goldsmith's shop. Not only are there all the instruments of the trade, but also many liturgical objects, carefully arranged on shelves. There is also a convex circular mirror on the right-hand side of St Eligius's table, in an obvious allusion to the Arnolfini Marriage by Jan van Eyk. In it we can see the reflection of a square, with a couple of passers-by. Although the presence of the saint gives the work a religious dimension, this remains essentially a genre painting: that is, a representation of secular and commercial activities, a scene from everyday life	CHRISTUS, Petrus	St Eligius in His Workshop	Oil on panel, 98 x 85 cm	1449	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

08247-23oldtes.jpg	Not until 1900, during restoration work in the church, did large sections of the old fresco decoration come to light again. The middle register of a depiction of the Last Judgment on the west wall of the basilica, fragments of the fresco of the Annunciation on the north wall, and two scenes from the story of Jacob on the south wall were uncovered. It is assumed that there were cycles of the Old and New Testament, respectively, on facing walls of the nave.The fragment of Jacob's Dream is on the south wall of the nave	CAVALLINI, Pietro	Jacob's Dream (fragment)	Fresco	c. 1300	religious	Italian	1251-1300

24095-4judith.jpg	Once owned by King Charles I of England, this painting illustrates an episode from the Old Testament which relates how the Israelite Judith by guile killed the Assyrian general Holofernes and thus saved her beleaguered city. Painted with minute detail, Judith and her handmaiden finish their deed with tragic calm.Among Mantegna's works there are several representations of Judith that, without exception, show a comparatively peaceful scene in which Judith is placing the severed head of Holofernes in a bag. During the Baroque, in contrast, the dramatic central moment of the action was preferred, as Judith, often with great effort, decapitates Holofernes.

08037-leblond.jpg	A sister-in-law of Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Rosalba Carriera achieves the same airy lightness of touch as her relative in her portraits. These were done in pastel and in them she explored the finest shadings of her subjects' characters, the most fleeting of their moods. Thus, without falling either into the dangers of the encomiastic portrait or of the documentary, Rosalba matches the immediacy of pastel technique to the freshness of her psychological and social penetration of her subjects, offering an unrivalled picture of the society of her time. In the Elderly Lady the mature beauty of the noblewoman and her serene good-natured existence are conveyed with incomparable skill. No less typical of her work is the portrait of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac with its superb rendering of the physical features of the subject, catching immediately the wilful character of the prelate.The artist uses her pastels with consummate skill in conveying the fresh innocence of the Young Lady of the Le Blond Family	CARRIERA, Rosalba	Young Lady of the Le Blond Family	Pastel on paper, 34 x 27 cm	c. 1730	portrait	Italian	1701-1750
14509-burning.jpg	This work of Froment's maturity, which is indeed an epitome of his whole oeuvre, was commissioned by King René of Provence. This central panel of the triptych represents Moses before the Burning Bush; the figures kneeling in prayer on the wing are the donor and his wife, Jeanne de Laval, accompanied by saints (not reproduced here). In this work the painter has abandoned the occasional crudities of The Raising of Lazarus; only in the countenance of Moses are there reminiscences of the more rigid portraiture of the earlier altarpiece. Moses is struck with astonishment at the vision before him and the appearance of the angel. The vision occupies the upper centre of the picture: amidst a great circle of flaming rose bushes the Madonna appears in a richly draped mantle, holding the Child. Christ holds a mirror in his hand, in which both of them are reflected. The picture contains a number of emblematical representations. The combination of a number of unusual elements side by side is characteristic of mediaeval symbolism. It is evidence of the extraordinary cult of the Virgin in the Middle Ages that it is she who appears before Moses, and not God, as in the Old Testament	FROMENT, Nicolas	The Burning Bush	Wood, 410 x 305 cm	1476	religious	French	1451-1500

40348-01prato.jpg	Those sections of the fresco cycle that are attributed to Paolo in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption in Prato Cathedral display a perfect compositional organization, created through a precise perspective pattern that places the simple, elegant buildings and the numerous human figures within a perfectly balanced spatial rhythm. Each of the characters has a different expression, evidence of a research into facial characteristics which will later become typical of Uccello's painting.In the scene of the Disputation of St Stephen, for instance, the beautiful face of the saint and those of the characters standing around him are portrayed with strongly marked expressions, in some cases even grotesque, in the attempt at giving each one individual characteristics. Behind this group of figures there is an architectural construction that is reminiscent of Brunelleschi's buildings. The accuracy and the perfect perspective of the drawing of this building is repeated also in the constructions in the background of the Stoning of St Stephen, for this reason correctly attributed to Uccello; the scene of Stephen's martyrdom, on the other hand, is the work of Andrea di Giusto	UCCELLO, Paolo	Disputation of St Stephen	Fresco, 300 x 360 cm	c. 1435	religious	Italian	1401-1450
24384-pandemon.jpg	"In the 1820s Martin produced a series of paintings depicting scenes of disaster, set in infinite, visionary spaces and full of theatrical, nightmarish lighting effects. Their basic mood largely derived from the artist's familiarity with John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost and with the biblical Apocalypse.The Pandemonium of 1841 goes back to a passage in the first book of Milton's Paradise Lost, in which ""Pandemonium, the palace of Satan, rises suddenly built out of the deep."" In a diagonal perspective characteristic of Martin, a gigantic building complex extends along the waterfront. This recalls fantastic reconstructions of cities of antiquity. Martin's Satan, whose invocatory figure stands on a rocky outcrop in the right foreground, has the look of an ancient Greek hero. Like Achilles outside Troy, he appears with shield and feathered helmet, but commanding an army not of besiegers but of demons and damned souls in their Cyclopean city"	MARTIN, John	Pandemonium	Oil on canvas, 123 x 184 cm	1841	other	English	1801-1850

33318-closedey.jpg	"This small painting is one of the painter's best-known works and is typical of Redon's symbolism. It shows a female face framed by long hair, painted in delicate and thinly applied colours. The woman's eyes are closed, her gaze directed inwards. The unreal blue of the background distances the face in the same way as the horizon. The head, absorbed in itself, is not a portrait. It could just as easily be called ""The Dream"" or ""Meditation"" - titles such as these occur again and again in Redon"	REDON, Odilon	Closed Eyes	Oil on canvas, 44 x 36 cm	1890	other	French	1851-1900

The left half depicts St Stephen being led to his martyrdom.In this scene he is portrayed at prayer following the description that 'he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.' (Apostles 8, v. 60). Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses.

05555-12marull.jpg	According to Berenson, the sitter of this portrait is Michele Marullo (1453-1500), known as Tarcaniota, a Greek humanist, who was the guest of the Medici's between 1489 and 1495. Later, in 1496, he returned to Florence and married the woman poet Alessandra Scala. He left Florence in 1490 and soon after he died by drowning into the river Cecina.This painting can be considered an ideal scholar portrait, a forerunner of those portrayals of philosopher-heroes developed in the seventeenth century, e.g. by Luca Giordano.The painting is in a very poor state of preservation	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Portrait of a Man	Tempera on canvas transferred from wood, 49 x 35 cm	c. 1490	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

07998-magnani.jpg	"This scene is part of the frescoed frieze painted in 1588-91 by the Carracci in the salone on the piano nobile of the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. The frieze depicts in 15 scenes the stories of the founding of Rome. The iconographical program of the frieze precisely follows the story of ""Parallel Lives"" by Plutarch. Each scene is accompanied by a motto written on a scroll beneath each box.One of the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. The twin brothers were purported to be sons of the Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their murderous uncle, they were abandoned at birth and put into a basket that was then placed into the River Tiber. The basket ran aground and the twins were discovered by a female wolf. The wolf nursed the babies for a short time before they were found by a shepherd. The shepherd then brought up the twins.When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them. The brothers quarrelled over where the site should be and Remus was killed by his brother. This left Romulus the sole founder of the new city and he gave his name to it &#150; Rome. The date given for the founding of Rome is 753 BC.Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf is the first scene of the cycle. It was executed by Lodovico Carracci. The motto beneath the scene reads: ""LAESI NON NECATI ALIMVR"" (Wounded, not killed, we are fed)"	CARRACCI, Lodovico	Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf	Fresco	1588-91	historical	Italian	1551-1600
37843-delazara.jpg	This polyptych is one of the very few surviving work that is universally considered to be by Squarcione. In a frame designed in a sophisticated late Gothic style are four side saints conceived like coloured sculpture on marble bases, unrelated of the conception of the central image. The focus of devotion, St Jerome, is in a different scale and has a different background than the surrounding saints.

25095-ursula.jpg	The present panel can be considered among the finest examples of the Master's works. It can be seen as a continuation of the great influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on artists not only in his adopted city of Brussels, but throughout the whole of the Low Countries.Ursula was the daughter of the Christian King Dionotus of Dumnonia. At her father's insistence she agreed to marry the pagan Conan Meriadoc of Armorica, but not before a religious pilgrimage to Rome, circa 383, so that her suitor could be baptized. Upon their return from Rome, the couple stopped in Cologne, where they, along with her eleven thousand virgin attendants, were intercepted by the Huns, then in control of the German city. The pagan Hunnish prince asked Ursula to be his bride, but he was rejected. As retribution, Ursula was put to death by arrows, along with her attendants, all of whom were beheaded. Here the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara depicts St. Ursula punctured by a single arrow, her identifying symbol, as she protects her attendants with her finely rendered robe	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Barbara	St Ursula Protecting the Eleven Thousand Virgins with Her Cloak	Oil on panel, 38 x 27 cm	1470-1500	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

05871-chiswic1.jpg	Lord Burlington created the most complex example of Palladian architecture. Chiswick House, built between 1723 and 1729, is close to the villas of the Veneto in Italy. The ground plan, a square containing a central octagon, recalls Palladio's Villa Rotonda. A suite of interconnecting geometric spaces surround the domed central hall; they extend into apses with statues in the niches.The exterior combines multiple references to antiquity. The six Corinthian columns of the portico are from the temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome, the semi-circular, subdivided windows of the drum are reminiscent of Roman thermal baths. These features do not represent a literal quotation from ancient buildings but rather a version of the sixteenth-century interpretations which were accessible to Burlington through Palladio's drawings and buildings	BOYLE, Richard, 3rd Earl of Burlington	Exterior view	Photo	1725-29	other	English	1701-1750

00879-40west.jpg	Sixtus II (257-258) had charged archdeacon Lawrence with dispersing the church's wealth to the needy. This deed aroused the ire of Emperor Valerian who had claimed the treasure for himself, and formed the basis for the charges brought against Lawrence and his eventual execution.In its setting in the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican, the dramatic impact of this fresco is aided by its position between two recessed windows. The scene is set in the nave of a basilica, the type of architectural space which in St Lawrence distributing Alms was used only as a backdrop. Five columns are visible on either side, and they are equalled in volume and monumentality by the bishops and other churchmen who witness St Lawrence kneeling before the Pope. The end wall of the basilica and its niche bring emphasis to no figure in the composition, for none stands at the centre. The central axis runs instead through the communion chalice which passes between the Pope and the saint.It is remarkable that in this fresco cycle the pope and the prelates wear azure vests, then rarely used and presently non-existent	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Consacrates St Lawrence as Deacon	Fresco, 271 x 197 cm	1447-49	religious	Italian	1401-1450

It is closely linked  to the atmospheres and colours of ""White Wall with White Furniture"" and ""Flox and Filox"", but the intensity and variety of its colours are in favour of ""When One Lives on One's Memories"".  Its composition is superb: by applying space near and far he expresses the physical and psychic departure of  the old woman, the central figure of the picture, whose relationship to the world is slowly fading. Greyish-blue of the second space are in an intrinsic contrast with the cheerful foreground full of colours, with elements of Rippl's former pictures, e.g. the red of the colourful head kerchief.

06994-10incafe.jpg	Caillebotte often found his subjects near the family home by the river Yerres. In 1880 an acquaintance modelled for his lifesize portrait of a café regular. The subject, technique, colouring, use of space, and subtle deployment of the mirror, all have something of Manet or Degas. But Caillebotte outdid Manet in expressing an entire social psychology in this portrait of a good-humoured, unfooled, slightly crafty man of the lower middle class	CAILLEBOTTE, Gustave	In a Café	Oil on canvas, 155 x 115 cm	1880	portrait	French	1851-1900
06475-01baptis.jpg	"Pieter Bruegel the Elder was the most important figure in sixteenth-century Flemish painting, the founder of a dynasty of painters. His realistic painting of peasants in both his secular and religious works gave him the nickname of ""Peasant Bruegel"". A number of copies of this picture, both contemporary and dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have come down to us, and many of them are in museums in Flanders (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels), as well as in Bonn, Schwerin, Leningrad, Munich and Cracow, mostly produced with the co-operation of his sons, Pieter and Jan, and his workshop employees. This tends to indicate that the picture remained in Brussels for a long time, or was in a collection in another town in the Netherlands which was easily accessible to the public.The numerous copies and variants of this painting with its theme of the Holy Baptism can also be explained by the widespread growth of the Anabaptist movement in those years of religious turbulence and strife. The date of the painting coincides with a period of iconoclasm in the Netherlands.This picture is probably identifiable as that known to have been in the collection of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Governor of the Netherlands, in 1633. In this, the preaching Saint John the Baptist is virtually lost in the colourful throng of peasants, cripples, gipsies, mischievous children climbing trees, and trees painted with astounding realism. Even the river in the background and the distant church take a more prominent role in the whole than the impersonal figure of the saint in his hair-shirt"	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	The Sermon of St John the Baptist	Oil on wood, 95 x 160,5 cm	1566	religious	Netherlandish	1501-1550

21367-allegory.jpg	Legranée received several royal commissions in a busy life. In the Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin the figures are not strictly allegorical, apart from the sorrowing France behind the bed, for they represent the dauphine and the couple's sons (including the dead one who appears with a crown of stars for his dying father), the effect is of allegory rather than fact. And the idiom in which the picture is painted is certainly classical, much as interpreted by Batoni, though critics of the day it suggested Guido Reni	LAGRENÉE, Louis-Jean-François	Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin	Oil on canvas, 129 x 97 cm	1765	mythological	French	1751-1800

30619-washing.jpg	In the 1880s, Lombardy began to play an active part in Italian art. The movement that originated there declared its loyalty to the great Italian tradition, and was particularly interested in atmospherics of light, colour, and texture. In the 1890s, such work came into its own with divisionist or pointillist paintings.In the work of Pellizza, the most important Lombard Neo-Impressionist, the goals of the leading French pointillist, Seurat, were most consistently pursued. This was apparent not only in his relinquishing romantic natural scenes such as Impressionism favoured, and preferring an art based upon ideas; he also dispensed with clear outlines, and used strong contrasts of juxtaposed colours. His thematic range was great, and included curiously symbolic paintings such as Washing in the Sun	PELLIZZA DA VOLPEDO, Giuseppe	Washing in the Sun	Oil on canvas, 87 x 131 cm	1905	landscape	Italian	1851-1900
11367-5delaroc.jpg	Anglomania was in fashion in France in the 1820s and 1830s. Interest in British history, fuelled by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, was further stimulated by parallels drawn between recent events in France and the turbulent accounts of Tudors, Stuarts and the Civil War. The pictorial representation of British history may have been pioneered in Britain, but it was the Frenchman Paul Delaroche who gained a European reputation with the grand scenes drawn from it which he exhibited at the annual Paris Salon between 1825 and 1835. Popularised through mass-produced engravings, these set pieces, combining ostentatious antiquarianism with the pseudo-realism of bourgeois melodrama, in turn influenced the painters of national history in mid-Victorian Britain.The painting depicts the last moments on 12 February 1554 in the life of the seventeen-year old Jane Grey, a great granddaughter of Henry VII who was proclaimed Queen of England upon the death of young King Edward VI, a Protestant like herself. She reigned for nine days in 1553, but, through the machinations of the partisans of Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor, she was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death in the Tower of London.Delaroche, who based the painting on a sixteenth-century Protestant martyrology, has falsified the historical account the better to appeal to his contemporaries. Lady Jane Grey, a humanist-educated young married woman, was in fact executed out of doors. Attended by two gentlewomen, probably no less stoical than she, she resolutely made her own way to the block. She could not have worn a white satin dress of nineteenth-century cut with a whalebone corset, and her hair would have been tucked up, not streaming down over her shoulders. But a painting cannot be judged by the criteria of historical accuracy. Much more applicable to this particular picture are the standards of popular melodrama and tableau vivant.As on a stage, the heroine gropes her way towards the audience, gently guided by the elderly Constable of the Tower whose massive, dark, male presence acts as a foil to her own. A spotlight trained on her from above complements the dim stage lighting, reflecting from her immaculate dress and the straw which spills over into the front row of the stalls. The emotions of each actor are carefully delineated and distinguished, and we are left in no doubt as to the character of each even of the lady in the background who turns her back on the terrible sight	DELAROCHE, Paul	The Execution of Lady Jane Grey	Oil on canvas, 246 x 297 cm	1833	historical	French	1801-1850

32267-19gather.jpg	It was already apparent to Poussin's contemporaries that the artist had given much thought, in The Israelites Gathering Manna, to the means by which painting could unfold a sequence of events before the eyes of the viewer. The artist combines selected aspects of the biblical story into one scene, so as to illustrate the scale of the Israelites' divine rescue from hunger and misery.This painting can be considered a variation on the Raphael fresco, The School of Athens, in the Vatican. Moses in particular, in his draperies and pointing gesture, directly cites the figure of Plato in Raphael's fresco. Poussin has simply transformed the latter's architectural backdrop into a rock formation and rotated the setting - which in the fresco lies parallel to the pictorial plane - as if on a turntable towards the right, so that it now leads away at a diagonal into the depths	POUSSIN, Nicolas	The Jews Gathering the Manna in the Desert	Oil on canvas, 149 x 200 cm	1637-39	religious	French	1601-1650
28588-paris5.jpg	Flags were flown on 30 June, 1878, to mark the opening of the Great Exhibition. On that day, a sea of flags was fluttering in the wind, and countless people filled the streets. Monet chose a high vantage point in order to emphasize the huge gathering of people. Viewed at close quarters, the milling throng gives the illusion of an ethereal carpet of colour. It is not until one is at a certain distance from the painting that the concrete aspect of the picture comes into focus, and the people on the streets become recognizable as well as the individual flags, which look as though they have been released from the façades of the houses to the left and right	MONET, Claude	Rue Montorgueil in Paris, Celebration of 30 June 1878	Oil on canvas, 81 x 51 cm	1878	historical	French	1851-1900

40992-02jeanbo.jpg	Although no mid-fourteenth century panel painting has come down to us, we can imagine what it may have been like in regarding this portrait of Jean le Bon, which is at the same time the earliest example of portraiture north of the Alps. The painter's brush is used with remarkable assurance, obviously practised in the creation of larger compositions as well. The artist has painted the sitter in profile against a golden background. The very individual character of the face is painted with great realism. A faintly perceptible smile hovers on the lips, the hair is red, the eyes blue. Without the inscription above his head 'Jehan, roi de France', one would hardly imagine it the portrait of a royal personage, a king whose life was full of vicissitudes, ruling during the hardships of the Hundred Years' War	UNKNOWN MASTER, French	Portrait of Jean le Bon, King of France	Wood, 60 x 44 cm	c. 1360	portrait	French	1351-1400
09498-1wedding.jpg	The Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.In this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory	CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM	The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis	Oil on canvas, 246 x 419 cm	1593	mythological	Dutch	1551-1600

15231-4recamie.jpg	This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. David started the portrait of Madame Récamier in 1800 which was never finished. (However, incidentally, this portrait helped a contemporary item of furniture to become known under her name.) When the master learned that the lady had also commissioned his pupil Gérard to paint her, he is said to have refused any further service.In David's portrait, noble simplicity, expressed by the simple dress and the Spartan decoration, is also eloquent in the open face. This might well appear more to the modern viewer than Gérard's version, which was judged to be more representative and flattering at the time. And comparisons with portraits of Madame Récamier by other artists suggest that Gérard had achieved a better likeness than David. The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.Gérard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation. Her low-cut bodice is seductive, the red curtain flatters the subject and gives the flesh a rosy tint. Where David gave the beautiful woman a rather severe touch around the mouth, Gérard embellishes her features with the hint of a gentle smile, making her look younger. By contrast, David's portrait in the antique manner looks rather forced. Perhaps these were the reasons why his painting was never finished. Madame Récamier gave Gérard's portrait of her to her admirer Prince Augustus of Prussia, a nephew of Frederick II, who had met the French beauty at the salon of Madame de Sta&#235;l. For state reasons a marriage was impossible, but in the painting Madame Récamier was ever present in the palace which Schinkel furnished for the Prince in 1817.After the death of the Prince the portrait was returned to Madame Récamier	GÉRARD, François	Madame Récamier	Oil on canvas, 255 x 145 cm	1805	portrait	French	1801-1850
25137-lucretia.jpg	Dr. Ellen Konowitz has recently reascribed all the panel paintings previously given to Dirck Vellert (who is known through his drawings, prints and stained glass) to the Master of the Lille Adoration, named for a painting in the Musée des Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. As the artistic production of this master continues to be more clearly defined and studied from the technical point of view, it has become evident that some works in the oeuvre of Jan Gossart most likely belong to this group as well: the Holy Family in Saint Louis, the Lucretia in a private collection, and the Portrait of a Man in Hamilton.This master was influenced in part by Gossart's works in the 1520s but never entirely abandoned his attachment to Antwerp Mannerism	MASTER of the Lille Adoration	Lucretia	Oil on panel, 46 x 37 cm	c. 1520-25	historical	Flemish	1501-1550

18921-21pardon.jpg	Guérin's Napoleon Pardoning the Rebels at Cairo has a grain of truth, since Napoleon had shown clemency to the Mamluk leaders of the 1798 rising - but only after the slaughter of most of the insurgents. Guérin burnishes Napoleon's myth subtly, placing his hero to the rear and rather dwarfed by those he has pardoned, in a sort of inverted modesty. If the rebels are allowed dignity in defeat, it is to emphasize the magnanimity of the victor.

09138-diane.jpg	Only two signed paintings by François Clouet are known to exist, of which this, generally regarded as one of the great masterpieces of the French Renaissance art, is one. The subject, shown seated in her bath, traditionally was believed to be the famous beauty, Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566), a favourite of Henry II and virtual ruler of France. However, this identification is now rejected, and the dating, placed either in the 1550s or around 1571 is debated. Diane do Poitiers. Other candidates for the identity of the sitter are Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) and Marie Touchet, mistress to Charles IX.This is the classic portrayal of a Royal mistress in her official role, cool, beautiful, aloof, bejewelled even in her bath, accompanied by the strappings of her state: fine rooms, a noble child in the arms of its leering, accomplice-nurse, the sly Love-child stealing the fruits, the flower of passion in her hand.Regarding the several influences, Titian's influence has been cited. The motif of the servant in the background performing a domestic chore is seen as deriving from the Venus of Urbino. The painting also shows affinities to the highly polished surfaces and icy eroticism of Bronzino. The pose of the woman in the bathtub was derived from a composition by Leonardo, known as the Monna Vanna (now lost	CLOUET, François	A Lady in Her Bath	Oil on wood, 92 x 81 cm	c. 1571	portrait	French	1551-1600

08192-garden.jpg	This painting is typical of those northern painters whose art was transformed by the Italian experience.The picture shows figures in the garden of the Villa Doria Pamphilj in Rome, with a view of the old church of San Pancrazio.

30955-belisari.jpg	The theme of Belisarius was much in vogue from the 1770s, and in addition to Jacques-Louis David, rival artists of David's own generation, such as Pierre Peyron and François-André Vincent, had painted their own versions of the subject. In Peyron's work, Belisarius is recognized by a peasant who had served under him, and praised as their protector and saviour by the rural family that now give him hospitality	PEYRON, Jean-François-Pierre	Belisarius Receiving Hospitality from a Peasant Who Had Served under Him	Oil on canvas, 93 x 132 cm	1779	historical	French	1751-1800
40383-2quarat1.jpg	"The predella, today in the Museo Arcivescovile in Florence, belonged to an altarpiece that has been lost (but was originally painted for the church of San Bartolomeo at Quarate). It is stylistically close to the Prato frescoes, and it consists of three scenes: St John on Patmos, the Adoration of the Magi and Saints John and Ansano.Although some scholars do not believe it is the work of Uccello, it can be placed chronologically in the group of paintings accepted as Uccello's work. As certain critics have pointed out, the Quarate predella shows the same interest in narrative, lively colours and description of details which is typical of Uccello's production in the years when he was working on the Prato frescoes (1435-40). A feeling of abstraction pervades these scenes, today no more than a group of fragments of faded and almost undecipherable images, in which we can make out a few architectural structures shown in accurate perspective and some monks laid out according to geometric patterns. In the extravagant choice of colours Uccello appears to have given his fantasy free rein; in fact, as Vasari noted, ""he did not pay much attention to the rule of consistency in colour, as was usual in the painting of stories; for he made the fields blue, the cities red, and the buildings the colour he felt like."

Armed with a cross, she pierced its belly and split the monster open, allowing her to walk free. She was eventually beheaded.The painting had a companion piece representing St Catherine of Alexandria whose cult was often linked to that of St Margaret's	CANDID, Peter	St Margaret of Antioch	Oil on panel, 51 x 34 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
15483-0chapel.jpg	"""... He did a chapel in Santissima Trinita for Francesco Sassetti with stories of St Francis, an admirable work, remarkable for its grace, finish and delicacy"" (Vasari).Francesco Sassetti had gained his wealth as a partner in the French branches of the Medici bank in Avignon and Lyon. He also spent over ten years representing the Medici bank in Genoa and occasionally in Geneva. But he was not always successful later on in his role as the chairman of the bank, and in 1484 was replaced by Giovanni Tornabuoni. By the end of the 1470s, Sassetti had already acquired the rights of patronage to a small side chapel, the second to the right of the choir in the Florentine church of Santissima Trinita. It was probable at this time that Ghirlandaio was commissioned to paint the chapel, which he decorated with frescoes between 1482 and 1485.The donor and his wife had themselves portrayed as life-sized figures kneeling in prayer at the side of the altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds. The donors are adoring the Christ Child, just like the shepherds in the panel painting. An incomplete inscription under their portraits names the day on which the chapel was consecrated, 25 December 1485, hence also the date by which it would have been completed. This year corresponds with the complete inscription on the altarpiece. In the Sassetti Chapel the artist combined secular, religious, and classical themes to produce a unique masterpiece.In the scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of contemporaries and views of Florence: he recreated religious events to the Florence of his day. In contrast to the newly built Saint Fina Chapel, the Sassetti Chapel was old and in the Gothic style. On each of its three walls Ghirlandaio painted two scenes from the life of Saint Francis, completed by a seventh fresco in the tympanum over the arched entrance to the chapel. At the crown of the entrance arch, the Sassetti coat of arms is surrounded by a garland of fruit, a sculptural work made of terracotta. The fresco in the tympanum above shows a sibyl prophesying Christ's dominion over the world to Emperor Augustus. The fresco idealizes the classical period as the precursor to the Christian age, and this provides a link with the chapel's high point, the altarpiece, which depicts the birth of Christ. The grisaille figure of David outside the chapel can also be interpreted in this way.On the two side walls of the chapel are the black marble sarcophagi of Francesco Sassetti and his wife Nera Corsi, set into niches with round arches. Here the sculptural decorations are dominated by classical motifs; the sculptor Giuliano da Sangallo is sometimes identified as the artist. The tomb niches are framed by grisaille frescoes, in which Ghirlandaio cites motifs from classical coins. Above each are two monumental frescoes by Ghirlandaio, which clearly owe a debt to traditional images. There are still echoes of the pictorial order established by Giotto in Assisi over 160 years earlier. Ghirlandaio studied Giotto's frescoes in the Bardi Chapel, dating from about 1325, in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence, and made direct use of them"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	View of the Sassetti Chapel	Fresco	1483-85	interior	Italian	1451-1500
05439-110madon.jpg	This painting shows the synthesis of trends that formed the style of Botticelli's painting. The composition of the painting resembles Lippi's art, but the figures are more delicately blended into the painting and their expressions and poses are more complicated.Behind the monumental, very sculptural figures is a broad, hilly landscape with a river. The boy-like angel appears to have just this moment stepped through the gap in the wall and come up to Mary and the child; he is presenting them with a bowl decorated with ears of grain and full of grapes. The Christ Child is blessing the gifts, which symbolize the bread and wine of the Eucharist.

22942-09ridott.jpg	"Pietro Longhi was first a pupil of Balestra and then of Crespi whose art was the source of his realism, which expressed a sober and sincere inner world, and a delight in detailed and fresh narrative. He conveyed his realism with wit and ease, whereas the immediacy with which he approached the landscape enriched his painting with a unique quality. Up to a certain point these elements can be discerned in pre-revolution French painting (Watteau, Chardin, Boucher and Lancret), whose influence also made itself felt in Pietro Longhi's realism. Only here and there did grotesque features appear in his art; he saw his figures with the eye of a sage and a gentle and witty impertinence is to be found in many of the scenes he depicted.Pietro Longhi became, by means of his genre-painting, one of the most faithful chroniclers of his age, and one who conjured up a regrettably vanished civilization. It should be borne in mind, however, that his connection with Goldoni and the teachings of Emilia encouraged him, through the observation of reality, to perform a kind of analysis of ""social depths""; he did not want to cause an upheaval but only wanted to point out &#151; perhaps tendentiously &#151; the ineptitude of a declining class of society. Although he did not pass sentence, he allowed his opinion to be known, being fully aware that changes were imminent. Sometimes he would ironically represent certain dandies, abbots and virgins"	LONGHI, Pietro	Il Ridotto	Oil on canvas	1740s	genre	Italian	1701-1750
14977-tahiti23.jpg	In 1889 Gauguin had painted a pair of works entitled Women Bathing (Life and Death) and Woman in the Waves (Ondine). The latter (in the Cleveland Museum of Art) depicts a naked woman, seen from behind, cast adrift in the waves, and in Fatata te miti he has reused the same subject, setting her within a Tahitian genre scene. In Ondine, Gauguin had treated the myth of the water-sprite who can only become human after having a child fathered by a man. Once again, he has explored the theme of the joy of sexual union as an essentially liberating activity, hinted at in the alternative title for The Loss of Virginity: The Awakening of Spring. In Fatata te miti the sexual abandonment is seen as part of the natural rhythm of Polynesian life (the two women do not appear perturbed at the presence of the fisherman in the background of the work), a notion that was integral to the highly popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read before visiting Tahiti and which was calculated to appeal to a Parisian audience	GAUGUIN, Paul	By the Sea (Fatata te Miti)	Oil on canvas, 68 x 92 cm	1892	landscape	French	1851-1900
38903-00bagli1.jpg	The frescoes decorating the main hall of the villa in Massanzago in the Province of Padua were attributed until the 1980s to various eighteenth-century painters, such as Jacopo Guarana, Giovanni Battista Crosato or Giambattista Pittoni. However, it turned out that the frescoes are the early works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Obvious stylistic and iconographic similarities between these frescoes and other early Tiepolo works were pointed out.The work at the Villa Baglioni began immediately after the wealthy Venetian publisher Giambattista Baglioni acquired in 1718 the seventeenth-century villa in Massanzago. The frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main hall, illusionistically breaking through the walls and creating a boundless space, thanks to the faux architectural structure conceived by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, who henceforth would be Tiepolo's most frequent collaborator, working on almost all of his large-scale decorative projects in Venice and the Veneto.The theme of the frescoes is the Myth of Phaethon, based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. The principal episode, Phaethon Asking His Father to Let Him Drive the Chariot of Sun, is staged on the east wall. The opposite wall is divided into two parts by the doors that lead into the hall from the monumental staircase. The right portion of the wall contains the Fall of Phaethon, the left part shows the Heliads, sisters of Phaethon. The frescoes on the short walls depict monochrome figures of the Four Regions of the World. The ceiling, which opens up to a faux sky, contains a depiction of The Triumph of Aurora	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	View of the main hall	Fresco	1719	interior	Italian	1701-1750

37103-1apostl2.jpg	The individual apostles cannot be identified with the exception of Peter and John, who stand in the panel to the left of the Christ-Thomas grouping. The idea of presenting pairs of apostles in debate is borrowed from the bronze doors that Donatello created for the Old Sacristy at San Lorenzo, Florence. Signorelli borrowed not only some of the compositional features of Donatello's reliefs but also specific iconographic details. Like Donatello, he depicts his apostles barefoot and draped in classical garments, eschewing any identifying attributes and even halos	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Pair of Apostles in Dispute	Fresco, 238 x 200 cm	1477-82	religious	Italian	1451-1500

09037-12sylvia.jpg	Claude's very last picture, the Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia is one of Claude's purest inspirations from the poetry of Virgil.In the painting the yellows have faded completely, leaving a bluish tinge over the whole, and the entire surface has been abraded. As a result the picture has an unnatural and ghostly feeling. The composition is one of Claude's most calculated, with trees, distant landscape and figures in total harmony. The Deruet-like figures are more.prominent than usual, with their bright blues and reds. The story is a tragic one: Ascanius accidentally shoots the stag of Sylvia, which unleashes a brutal war of revenge. It is fitting that Claude should have ended his career on this theme without depicting brutality, as it sums up his gentleness of temperament as an artist.The painting was executed for the Principe Colonna and was still in the collection in 1783	CLAUDE LORRAIN	Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia	Oil on canvas, 120 x 150 cm	1682	landscape	French	1651-1700

07586-53mercy0.jpg	From the fiefs of the Colonna family Caravaggio took refuge in Naples, in 1606. There he began to work again with his usual, astounding speed. Early in January 1607 he was paid for the immense altarpiece commissioned to him by the Pio Monte di Misericordia (where it may still be seen today). The painting shows the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is very complicated in its organization. Caravaggio actually had to add a series of figures (two angels and the Madonna and Child, the latter painted later) in the upper part of the painting, which make the composition of the picture the most complex, perhaps, in any of his works. Caravaggio did not paint exemplary episodes intended to stir the viewer to religious piety through the illustrative emphasis of gestures and feelings. Rather, he entrusted the educational effectiveness of his works to the evidence of things in themselves, in the conviction that nothing should be added above and beyond what is already contained in the intrinsic eloquence of the various poses.The seven acts of mercy represented on the painting are the following. On the right appear the (1) burial of the dead and the episode of the so-called Carita Romana (Cimon's daughter giving her father suck in prison), which contains at once the two charitable acts of (2) visiting prisoners and (3) feeding the hungry. (4) Dressing the naked appears in the foreground, symbolized by St. Martin and the beggar. Next to this scene, the host and St. James of Compostela allude to the (5) offering of hospitality to pilgrims. (6) Relieving the thirsty is represented by Samson drinking from the ox jaw. The youth on the ground behind the beggar of St. Martin may also represent the merciful gesture of (7) caring for the sick.We readily apprehend the artist's power of synthesis, which concentrates a conceptual content that is potentially quite dispersive, in the model behavior of a few figures. The large painting was widely copied and studied by seventeenth-century Neapolitan painters, who drew ideas and formal devices from it	CARAVAGGIO	The Seven Acts of Mercy	Oil on canvas, 390 x 260 cm	c. 1607	religious	Italian	1551-1600

29969-winter_s.jpg	Isack van Ostade was the short-lived younger brother of the painter of scenes from peasant life, Adriaen van Ostade. They were both born, lived and worked in Haarlem, and Isack was a pupil of his brother who was eleven years his senior. Isack joined the guild in 1643. His earliest paintings - the first dated picture is from 1639 - are peasant interiors dependent on Adriaen's, but towards the end of his brief career he became more interested in outdoor scenes and produced a series of beautiful and original landscapes, often set in winter. This deliberately picturesque view, its low viewpoint serving to outline the wooden bridge against the sky, is one of his finest paintings. It is rich in its treatment of the details of peasant life, whose harsh aspects (as seen, for example, in the figure of the man labouring under his load of faggots) are relieved by the pleasure taken by the child in the anticipation of skating on the frozen river.

34866-hercules.jpg	The subject of the painting was taken from the Biblotheca by Apollodoros. The mythological story depicted in the painting is the following.For murdering his friend Iphitus in a fit of madness Hercules was sold as a slave to Omphale, queen of Lydia, for three years (Apollodorus 2.6:3). But she soon alleviated his lot by making him her lover. While in her service he grew effeminate, wearing women's clothes and adornments, and spinning yarn.

41169-x_sebast.jpg	This panel was one of the side wing of an altar triptych which the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder produced for the Bishop of Eichst&#228;tt. The local patron saints Willibald and Walburga, adored by the bishop, occupied the central panel, which is now in the Historical Museum in Bamberg. The side wings with Sts Sebastian and Roch on the inner sides are still in the possession of the diocese.The representation of St Sebastian does not follow the pictorial tradition, he is only recognisable in the general iconographic context and from the arrow, his attribute, which he holds in his hands. His contemporary dress and facial features suggest a portrait of Count Philipp of Solms-Lich as a historiated portrait. Count Philipp of Solms-Lich (1468-1544) was an imperial councilor under Maximilian I and Charles V, and at the electoral court of Frederick the Wise	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	St Sebastian	Tempera on wood	c. 1520	religious	German	1501-1550

21482-eremiti1.jpg	Shortly after the completion of the ceiling in the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese, Annibale and his pupils, who included Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco, were asked to provide decorations for a palazzetto behind Palazzo Farnese, across the Via Giulia. The decoration consisted of mainly landscapes. In keeping with the character of the building, a casino in a garden, they represented mythological episodes. A few years later, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese decided to add a small room (Camerino degli Eremiti) to the Palazzetto Farnese as a Christian retreat where he could withdraw for his devotion. Giovanni Lanfranco was responsible for its entire decoration which consisted of four large frescoes, and nine ceiling panels, only two of which survived, Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels and Christ Served by Angels	LANFRANCO, Giovanni	Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels	Oil on canvas, 109 x 78 cm	c. 1616	religious	Italian	1601-1650
11201-1880s_20.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	Woman Combing Her Hair	Pastel on paper on cardboard, 87 x 57 cm	1887-90	genre	French	1851-1900
24868-madonna1.jpg	Although in the 1440s Filippo Lippi explored a variety of solutions for showing the Madonna and Child within or against an architectural niche, with the Child resting on a parapet - the finest example is that in Washington - in none of these is there a similar illusionistic intent, with the parapet and tabernacle window conceived as though projecting into the viewer's space. The point of reference for the author of this painting was certainly Donatello' Pazzi Madonna.The artist of this picture certainly spent time in the workshop of Filippo Lippi: the spherical heads and curiously boneless hands relate to Lippi's works of the late 1430s - especially the Tarquinia Madonna and the Barbadori Altarpiece	MASTER of Pratovecchio	Madonna and Child	Tempera on wood, 99 x 70 cm	1440s	religious	Italian	1451-1500
23627-refector.jpg	The Genoese Alessandro Magnasco was taught by his father Stefano and a little known Milanese painter, Filippo Abbiati, and began by painting in a conventional seventeenth-century style. During his stay in Florence at the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, he became acquainted with the work of Salvator Rosa and the etchings of Callot, and under their influence developed a content and style of his own. His themes were bizarre, different from anything to be seen in Genoa, Milan, or indeed anywhere in Italy; nor did his manner of painting resemble that of any other artist in Italy. He depicted imaginary scenes, capriccios in many of which monks are seen in strange settings or tiny figures in stormy landscapes. In his paintings, which are usually small, the figures are oddly elongated, the strokes of the brush vibrating and restless; indeed, everything seems to be in flickering movement.The number of people depicted in this painting and the richness of the decorations lead us to think that this may have been the General Chapter of the Franciscan Order	MAGNASCO, Alessandro	The Observant Friars in the Refectory	Oil on canvas, 176 x 143 cm	c. 1740	religious	Italian	1701-1750
07880-1camerin.jpg	The Villa Caldogno is the result of one of Palladio's early projects. Its construction began in 1542, at the behest of Losco Caldogno, an aristocrat and silk merchant from Vicenza, who had inherited an agricultural complex and fields in Caldogno the year before. Construction of the building and the decoration of the interiors extended over a long period of time, brought to completion only in 1570.The fresco decoration of the loggia, the Central Hall, and two other rooms (Room of Scipio and Room of Sofonisba) was completed by Giovanni Antonio Fasolo and Giovanni Battista Zelotti by 1570. In 1646, the interior distribution of the space was modified and a new small room (camerino), connecting the Room of Scipio and the Room of Sofonisba, was frescoed by the young Venetian painter Giulio Carpioni. These frescoes illustrate scenes from Guarino Guarini's Pastor Fido (The Faithful Shepherd). The room was partly frescoed earlier by an unidentified sixteenth-century painter with some episodes taken from Torquato Tasso's Aminta.Carpioni's paintings in the camerino unfold in three compartments on the walls, each containing an episode from the poem; the compartments are embellished along the side edges with refined, colourful floral festoons. The scenes depict: The Coronation of the Nymph Amaryllis, Winner of the Kissing Competition; The Pursuit of Corsica by a Satyr; and the Wounding of Dorinda, Mistaken by the Shepherd Silvio for One of His Prey. In the corners of the room, as a connective element, are two unusual, extremely lively candelabra.

34926-07gartem.jpg	The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. When establishing the narrative composition, priority was given to the arrangement of narrative events rather than to the continuous narrative flow. Thus, popular subjects, such as Noah's Ark, were made to stand out in spectacular fashion.As was common in the Middle Ages, the artist who created this picture showed the ark as a lateral elevation. Judging by its hull, the ark is a Viking ship with a stem fortified by monsters, and a three-story superstructure and small wheel-house just as described in the Bible.

07775-60meetin.jpg	"Canvas No. 6 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The same colour tone and mood as in the Apotheosis, but used in a much more self-assured perspective composition, appears again in the Meeting between Pope Cyriacus and the Pilgrims. Scholars do not agree on the dating of this canvas and suggestions go from 1491, the same year as the Apotheosis of St Ursula, to 1493, the year of the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula. Even the question of the identification of the character in red standing next to Pope Cyriacus as Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Humanist and the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1493 after having fallen out of grace in Venice, is used in different ways by the advocates of the various chronological theories. The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490.The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls"	CARPACCIO, Vittore	The Pilgrims Meet the Pope	Tempera on canvas, 281 x 307 cm	c. 1492	religious	Italian	1501-1550

The wings show the two St Johns with the `living' figures of Adam and Eve in niches on the exterior (seen when the wings are closed).For the first time the painting includes the italianate motif of putti stretching festoons across the scene at the top. Similar figures appear on a couple of other occasions in Memling, including the Resurrection triptych (Paris, Musée du Louvre) and the Virgin Enthroned in Florence	MEMLING, Hans	Triptych	Oil on wood, 69 x 47 cm (central), 63,5 x 18,5 cm each wing)	c. 1485	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

13919-p_hulft.jpg	Gerard Pietersz. Hulft (1621-1656) was First Councillor and Director-general of the VOC (Dutch East India Company). The portrait within the painted frame is typical of Flinck's style in the 1650s. By then he had largely abandoned a Rembrandtesque style in favour of a brighter manner of painting inspired by Van Dyck. The still-life surrounding the portrait is unique in Flinck's portrait oeuvre	FLINCK, Govert Teunisz.	Portrait of Gerard Pietersz. Hulft	Oil on canvas, 130 x 103 cm	1654	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
32150-y_bull.jpg	In the work of Paulus Potter views of nature and animals are seen for their own sake, and not as a backdrop for human action. Potter can paint equally well the bright sunlight and the cool air, but his real fame lies with his penetrating portraits of animals. His best-known work is the life-size Young Bull, an unusual heroization of a single animal, a counterpart to the monumental trend of Ruisdael and Cuyp.Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages. The ancient Greek painter Zeuxis used a similar method; when he painted his portrait of Helen in the city of Croton he chose five beautiful virgins, in order to copy the finest features of each, for in one woman he felt he could not find perfect beauty.What makes this painting so special is the fact that Potter painted something as ordinary as a bull on such a grand scale - which had never been done before. And despite this large size, he paid great attention to the smallest details.During the nineteenth century the Young Bull by the twenty-two-year-old Potter ranked close in fame to the Night Watch of Rembrandt. Later generations have been less captivated by Potter's fidelity to nature when he worked life-size. Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless. Atmosphere enters the picture only in the lovely distant view on the right, where a sunny light plays upon the cattle in the meadows and on the woods, making this passage one of his loveliest landscapes. Potter is more consistent on a small scale, and his cabinet pieces show him at his best.	POTTER, Paulus	The Young Bull	Oil on canvas, 236 x 339 cm	1647	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
13632-09ferenc.jpg	According to the Bible, the older brothers who were jealous of their father's love sell Joseph to the Ishmailites (Book IV of the Old Testament). The picture  shows the most tragic scene of the betrayal. Joseph, stripped to the waist, is seized and led to the merchants in white burnous who have just arrived. Ferenczy's picture, which is the largest of all in size, opens prospects: in the background of the scene  there is a huge plain area with figures lining up in the foreground. It is not necessary to know the biblical story to understand what is going on. The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background. The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.The picture was painted from beginning to end in the open air, as it is known from Valér's letter to his father, the size of the picture must have presented a lot of technical problems.

17802-706goya.jpg	Like many other uncommissioned works, the subject of this painting has been interpreted in various ways and it has borne several descriptive titles. The woman reading the letter has been thought to be a portrait. One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'. It has also been suggested that Goya intended this painting as a pendant to Time and the Old Women. The two canvases are almost exactly the same size, were acquired for the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille, at the same time and have the same provenance. But there seems to be no obvious connection between the subjects of the two paintings and Time and the Old Women, which is known to have been in Goya's possession in 1812, is almost certainly a slightly earlier work. There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings. But the composition is less contrived and, as in many other works, chiefly the uncommissioned ones, it appears to be based on a scene that the artist had witnessed and recorded on the spot or from memory. This was one of four paintings by Goya in the collection of King Louis Philippe which had been obtained in Madrid from Goya's son	GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de	Les Jeunes or the Young Ones	Oil on canvas, 181 x 122 cm	1812-14	other	Spanish	1801-1850
24478-portrait.jpg	The painting is in a poor state of conservation, the colours have altered dramatically. However, the portrait has an extraordinary presence. The face, defined by its sharp contour, is modeled like sculpture. The three-dimensional effect of the mazzocchio (the turban) is emphasized by being cut at the right edge of the picture. The portrait can be compared with various portraits by Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, especially the bystanders in the scene of St Peter preaching. This comparison points to a date about 1426-27, making this panel the earliest surviving independent portrait in fifteenth-century Florence	MASACCIO	Profile of a Man	Tempera on wood, 41 x 30 cm	1426-27	portrait	Italian	1401-1450
38264-maurice.jpg	St Maurice is a legendary warrior saint, the commander of the 'Theban Legion', Roman troops from Thebes in Egypt, who served at Agaunum in Gaul (St-Maurice en Valais) in the 3rd century. He is dressed in medieval armour. The story, whose authenticity is debated, relates that the soldiers, at the instigation of Maurice, refused to participate in certain pagan rites. They were punished by the Emperor Maximian Herculeus first by decimation and finally by the wholesale massacre of the legion. Maurice and his fellow officers were executed in A.D. 287.According to another interpretation, the warrior saint is identified as St Secundus	STROZZI, Bernardo	St Maurice and the Angel	Oil on canvas, 82 x 101 cm	c. 1640	religious	Italian	1601-1650
23922-tavern.jpg	In the 1620s in Roman circles, a definite change came about in the subject matter of musical paintings. The representation of figures playing musical instruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's Lute Player and Musicians) disappeared. Within the space of a very few years they were replaced by large numbers of representations of concerts in public places and 'popular' locations. One of the earlier examples of this new trend is Bartolomeo Manfredi's Tavern Scene with a Lute Player. One characteristic of the painting, besides the presence of the lute player in a non-musical context (he simply accompanies a scene in which people are eating and drinking), is the absence of a musical score, an attribute of 'cultivated' musical painting.

21820-guitar.jpg	In this elegant genre scene, a young woman holding a guitar with her hand tries to play the instrument. The most striking element within the composition is the woman leaning out of the window. Her main role in this painting is to represent the five senses: touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing. Hearing symbolized by the guitar, touch and sight by the butterfly, smell by the perfume of the plant, and taste by the oranges on top of the rock.

17967-06monte1.jpg	"After completing the cycle of St Francis, Benozzo painted the first bay in the monastery church's southern side aisle, known as the Chapel of St Jerome. The main wall shows a painted polyptych, the Madonna and Child surrounded by Saints. This creates the illusion that it continues in the fresco painted above it, as if it were a realistic addition in front of the wall. The curtain and the shadows of the pinnacles and triangular gables make a considerable contribution to creating this impression. Benozzo's artistic capabilities here reached the highest level of illusion. It addition, it is remarkable that the artist ""placed"" the Gothic work within a classical framework which he signed OPUS BENOZII DE FLORENZIA.Above the polyptych Christ on the Cross can be seen surrounded by four angels who are catching the blood dripping from his wounds. On either side below him, St Dominic and St Francis are kneeling on the left side, and St Romuald and St Sylvester on the right. The walls show St Jerome in the desert and the martyrdom of St Sebastian. In the vault the four evangelists appear with their attributes: St Matthew with the angel, St Mark with the lion, St Luke with the ox and St John with the eagle.

18377-1704grec.jpg	There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions. He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition. The version in the Budapest museum is a good example of the vertical type. There are other vertical versions in Andújar, in Cuenca and in Buenos Aires. The intervention of El Greco's workshop can be assumed in all these paintings.In his religious compositions and portraits El Greco frequently repeated themes from his major works, with slight alterations, to meet different commissions. He broke away from the Renaissance tradition and ceased to depict reality and nature. In order to convey mystic emotions and to imbue his work with passion he distorted and elongated the forms and used stridently blazing colours to express the transcendental. The Agony in the Garden is such mystic interpretation representative of El Greco's late years and mature style.The painting depicts the last night of Christ on the Mount of Olives. In the foreground the tired pupils are sleeping, their unnaturally rigid robes refer to the wax models which the aged master used. Above them Christ is kneeling while an angel appears. The scene is a grassy clearing which looks like to be a lighted stage.

14954-tahiti01.jpg	Gauguin's Tahitian paintings celebrate the lushness and mysterious splendour of his new environment. At the same time they are seldom correct pictures of Tahitian life, from an anthropological standpoint, but rather feature recastings and recombinations of objects and persons taken out of their normal settings, as was the case with several of his paintings done in Brittany.The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau). In Ia Orana Maria Gauguin places the Christian story into a setting where both the figures and the vegetation are Polynesian. A Tahitian woman, her young son, and two women standing nearby are shown in the obvious attitudes of the Virgin and Child with attendant saints or worshiping angels.Once again Gauguin has returned to the theme of the effect of profound religious faith on an apparently simple people, which had preoccupied him in some of his most important Breton works. The apparently effortless fusion of Christian iconography with Tahitian subject matter is in fact carefully contrived, with the poses of the background figures lifted from the relief carving on the Javanese temple of Borobudur, photographs of which Gauguin had taken with him to Tahiti	GAUGUIN, Paul	Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary)	Oil on canvas, 114 x 88 cm	1891	religious	French	1851-1900
21307-09magdam.jpg	Around 1620 a group of young French painters developed interesting derivations from works by Caravaggio. Among these we find Georges de la Tour. In his canvases he adopted the strong light and shade contrasts characteristics of Caravaggio's school, although in his chiaroscuro effects he preferred the Nordic tenebrosi's use of artificial light, such as candles and torches, which produces a dazzling effect and creates a more transcendental atmosphere that does not include the supernatural.

04123-peasants.jpg	Nicolaes Berchem, the son of a distinguished still-life painter, Pieter Claesz., was born in Haarlem. The town was a leading centre of landscape painting in the early seventeenth century and among Berchem's teachers was the landscapist Jan van Goyen. Like many Dutch artists, Berchem travelled to Italy immediately after completing his apprenticeship. He was in Rome late in 1642 and remained there for three years. While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes. As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments. These buildings cannot be identified, as they are only loosely modelled on actual ruins. Berchem uses a bright, highly-coloured palette and applies the paint in short, stabbing brush strokes.In seventeenth-century Holland there was a constant demand for exotic landscapes of this type and Berchem was a highly successful artist. He moved to Amsterdam, which had a larger art market than Haarlem, in about 1677. His work was widely imitated and copied during his lifetime and his paintings enthusiastically sought after in France in the eighteenth century and in England in the nineteenth. This painting, having been in the distinguished Amsterdam collection of Gerrit Braamcamp in the mid-eighteenth century, was bought in Paris by the Duc de Chabot in 1780 and in London in 1840 by Sir Robert Peel	BERCHEM, Nicolaes	Peasants with Cattle by a Ruined Aqueduct	Oil on wood, 47 x 39 cm	c. 1658	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

38716-girlhold.jpg	In addition to the paintings by Caravaggio, Terbrugghen was also inspired by Northern imagery from the sixteenth century and by the subject matter and figure style of his contemporary, Dirck van Baburen. The two artists probably shared a studio in Utrecht, and around 1620 both artists produced series of genre scenes with single figures - musicians, singers, smokers and drinkers. These genre scenes were often produced in pairs.Terbrugghen's figures have often been interpreted as allegories of the Five Senses. The present painting has been seen as interpreting Taste. It was only partly executed by Terbrugghen, the painting was completed by another, inferior hand in his workshop	TERBRUGGHEN, Hendrick	Girl Holding a Tankard and a Glass	Oil on canvas, 103 x 84 cm	1626	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
42435-scene1.jpg	Originally this panel formed part of a series of paintings consisting of five consecutive scenes, each accompanied by a saying (Poverty leads to Cunning; Cunning leads to Wealth; Wealth leads to Luxury; Luxury leads to Misery; and Misery leads to Death). Each scene shows two main figures walking, dancing or stumbling through a sketchily rendered landscape. In Poverty leads to Cunning they are two old, blind musicians, the man playing a hurdy-gurdy and the woman a rommelpot. The inscription is written on a curling banderole lying on the ground.These monochrome oil paintings on panel are universally referred to as grisailles although in this case it is actually in shades of brown (brunaille)	VENNE, Adriaen Pietersz. van de	"Armoe' Soeckt List (""Poverty Leads to Cunning"")"	Oil on panel, 37 x 31 cm	1630s	genre	Dutch	1601-1650

38632-bp_advic.jpg	"This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his ""Die Wahlverwandtschaften"" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs. Contrary to Vermeer's paintings, the dim light and the subdued chiaroscuro do not allow a forceful grasp of the whole field of vision. The light comes mostly from the front and stops at the glossy surfaces of the costumes and other textures"	TERBORCH, Gerard	Paternal Admonition (Gallant Conversation)	Oil on canvas, 71 x 73 cm	c. 1654	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

30779-8study3.jpg	There are drawings related to the frescoes in the Collegio del Cambio that are so precise and delicate that earlier scholars felt them to be preliminary drawings by Perugino, but today they are considered to be workshop products reproduced for study purposes. Only a very few drawings are now generally recognized as genuine studies by Perugino himself, including one for the Cumaean Sibyl. Its impetuous, sketchlike style makes it clear that it was a design drawing	PERUGINO, Pietro	Cumaean Sibyl	Pen and ink on white paper, 203 x 86 mm	1497-1500	religious	Italian	1451-1500
15943-venus.jpg	Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter. The Sleeping Venus is a case in point. The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting. She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature. Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies. Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed. Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world. Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master. In the Sleeping Venus a significant share has been assumed for Titian, especially in the landscape, where on the right a cupid has been painted out. The outstretched figure, stocky in proportions, is usually considered to be by Giorgione. The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface. But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality. Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject. There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed. If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death	GIORGIONE	Sleeping Venus	Oil on canvas, 108 x 175 cm	c. 1510	mythological	Italian	1451-1500
17731-218goya.jpg	The old superstitious, heathen cult of Pan that was persecuted by the Church but which still persisted in the more remote corners of the country was the subject of Goya's attack in this painting. Among a group of fanatic and stupidly credulous women and witches sits a huge ram, demanding one of the children as sacrifice. On the ground lies the emaciated body of a child.

38424-2louis.jpg	Bertalan Székely was the most fastidious master of the style known as historicism. He harboured the idea of painting The Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second already during the years he spent in Transylvania following his studies in Vienna. After having clarified the role of each element of the composition, he painted the great work in 1860 in Munich, where he was studying under Piloty. Working out the structure and the accent of colours in detail was of prime importance for Székely.The last Hungarian king from the Jagello Dynasty, the young Louis II (1516-1526), was slain in the Battle of Mohács. His passing symbolizes the death of the nation and the beginning of the Turkish suzerainty which lasted 150 years. The gestures of respect for the dead as well as the white shroud, which contrast dramatically with the sombre atmosphere, work in unison to focus our attention on the tragic figure of the Hungarian king	SZÉKELY, Bertalan	Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second	Oil on canvas, 140 x 182 cm	1860	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

34948-5oberze4.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the third scene on the north wall: The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. The second scene includes a building on the right with a white wall made of ashlars. The same wall can be seen on the left-hand side of the adjoining scene, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, then suddenly stops. This is where the Sea of Galilee begins. Also visible is the boat which is soon to find itself in a storm. The white ashlar walls must therefore form part of the fortification of the city which reaches down to the harbour	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, German	The Storm on the Sea of Galilee	Fresco	c. 980	religious	German	0951-1000

43957-2luke.jpg	"A sixth-century legend presents Luke as the painter of a number of icons of the Virgin.

The evangelist, who supposedly practiced medicine, is shown dressed like a Flemish doctor; in the Middle Ages he was considered the patron saint of painters, physicians, and apothecaries. It has been suggested that this  is a self-portrait.

The outlines are very sharply defined, and the movement of nerves and tendons observed down to the last detail. Antonio del Pollaiuolo worked at time when thorough studies of anatomy were being made, and he therefore renders the human body realistically in its moments of greatest emotional excitement.The dramatic force of the episode is expressed in the hero's grimace of fatigue and horror, but also his certainty of victory.

23993-6sebasti.jpg	In 15th-century Italian art, portrayals of St Sebastian offered the opportunity of depicting an idealized nude figure in a classical setting. Mantegna tied the saint to the column of a triumphal arch both to emphasize his heroism and at the same time to stress the precise historic setting. The triumphal arch stands in a courtyard closed off by a wall. Debris from statues and a fragment of bacchanalian relief lie around, indicating the fall of the pagans and the victory of Christianity.A bearded horseman can be seen in the cloud to the left. Images in the cloud like this, already described in classical art theory and adopted by Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci, were ascribed to the genius of nature, which could stimulate artists and inspire them to improve on nature with their creations.The vertical inscription at the right side of the saint is the signature of Mantegna in Greek	MANTEGNA, Andrea	St Sebastian	Tempera on wood, 68 x 30 cm	1459	religious	Italian	1451-1500

13143-glorific.jpg	"The cross as the focal point of the ""gloria del paradiso"" is revered by the saints and the elect of the heavenly realm who surround the cross on banks of clouds. On the right, we recognize the patriarchs, including Moses, Abraham and King David. We also see Jonas sitting on the fish, looking up towards the cross, and St Catherine and Mary Magdalene in a sisterly embrace. In the foreground, there is a disputation between St Sebastian and Pope Gregory, St Jerome, St Ambrose and St Augustine, with the first Christian martyrs St Stephen and St Laurence. The cross, clutched by a kneeling female figure who is probably an embodiment of Faith, is surrounded by angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, above which we can make out the Evangelists and Apostles. At the head of a procession of angels streaming into the dazzling light of the background, which is flooded with an overwhelming brightness, we can see the Coronation of the Virgin.Elsheimer's unique art is evident in the astonishing illusion of remarkable breadth and depth achieved by this small panel painting. Here, space is no longer simply a problem of continuously reduced scale, but also one of simultaneous graduation of colour and the distribution of light and darkness. This creates interlocking areas of colour and light which, though perceived by the eye, nevertheless take on the quality of a vision.

Although the composition of the painting is quite conventional, the figures display a new fluidity in their poses and in the movements of their drapery which is suggestive of the International Style then being employed in sculpture by Ghiberti and Niccol&#242; Lamberti. Surface patterns vie for attention with the volumes of the figures; even the superimposition of figures tends to read as pattern. Brilliant, light-toned colour and the lavish use of gold and expensive ultramarine blue pigment would have made the painting a strong focal point in the church and would also have testified to its importance and to the donor's extraordinary generosity	LORENZO Monaco	The Coronation of the Virgin	Tempera on wood, 450 x 350 cm	1414	religious	Italian	1401-1450

The vera icon was a favourite subject of paintings and graphic works in the late Middle Ages.The type of image derives from Early Netherlandish painting (Jan van Eyck and Dieric Bouts the Elder)	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Christ's Head with Crown of Thorns	Oil and tempera on limewood, 28 x 21 cm	1520-25	religious	German	1501-1550

04559-yosemite.jpg	Albert Bierstadt, a native of Germany, stood in the tradition of the Hudson River School, founded by the English-born Thomas Cole, which marked the beginning of a genuinely American landscape painting. He discovered the American wilderness for art, applying these means in the tradition of Claude Lorrain. In 1863, Bierstadt and the writer Fritz Hugh Ludlow set off on an expedition to the Wild West, which took them thousands of miles through the dramatic scenery of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, and Oregon. The artist captured these impressions in a series of large-format panoramas that made him the founder of the Rocky Mountain School.Yosemite Valley at Sunset was a preliminary study for one of these large paintings. As dramatic as the area is in reality, Bierstadt heightened it still further, plunging the scene into a veritably mythical illumination. Bierstadt's views and the stereoscopic photographs his two brothers made of the Yosemite Mountains contributed to the declaration of the area as a national park	BIERSTADT, Albert	Yosemite Valley at Sunset	Oil on cardboard, 30 x 49 cm	1864	landscape	American	1851-1900
14560-06macbet.jpg	Fuseli was the second son of the Zurich portraitist and author Johann Caspar Fussli. His early contact with the teachings of Johann Jakob Bodmer familiarized him with the figures of world literature, which were to remain a major source of inspiration throughout his career. Ordained in 1761 as a pastor in the Zwinglian Reformed Church, he left Zurich two years later for political reasons, traveling by way of Berlin to London, where he settled. Initially Fuseli made his living by writing, while engaged in illustrating the works of his favourite authors, particularly William Shakespeare.The painting represents a scene from Shakespeare's Macbeth. It shows Lady Macbeth as a a sleep-walker in the corridor of a fortress. The terrified eyes of Lady Macbeth, by now lost between reality and nightmare, clutch at the viewer, almost as though trying to capture him and carry him off into her own unknown dimension	FUSELI, John Henry	Lady Macbeth	Oil on canvas, 221 x 160 cm	1784	other	Swiss	1751-1800
33484-02histor.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 468.The subject of the painting is debated. Some of the critics thinks it represents Artemisia taking the ashes of Mausolos, while others assume it shows Sophonisba taking the cup of poison. In any cases, it is a representation of matrimonial love therefore it is assumed that the painting depicts Saskia, the wife of the artist.Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory.

20890-port_you.jpg	Even at the age of eleven, Angelica Kauffmann earned admiring praise for her portrait of Bishop Nevroni and although she would later concentrate on allegorical, antique, historical and religious themes in her paintings, the portrait was to remain the driving force behind her success throughout her life. She received so many commissions that her painting tended to become rather routine, taking on an increasing smoothness and superficial appeal at the expense of a more distinctive style. This Portrait of a Young Woman also has something routine about it, and is as pleasingly decorative as any interior decor that she might have created in her frequent collaboration with the English architect Robert Adam. Nevertheless, it does show a face as that of a highly sensitive personality	KAUFFMANN, Angelica	Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil on canvas, 130 x 102 cm	1781	portrait	Swiss	1751-1800
26106-28jerome.jpg	The legend of this fourth-century doctor of the Church only began to take shape in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting. Small, transparent droplets of blood well up from his bruised chest. His scarlet cardinal's cloak and hat lie on the ground behind him, as if he had just cast them off. The lion lies down faithfully beside him. The scene is enacted on a rocky plateau before a cave, which is the hermit's retreat.This fairly large panel is not very well known, and is sometimes treated with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, it is a fine example in every respect of Memling's vision and technique. Monumentally conceived, yet executed with an undramatically fresh and guileless realism, this St Jerome is one of the most elegant large figures in the artist's oeuvre. The spatial character of the slim, half-naked saint is comparable with the Stuttgart Bathsheba. The extremely free underdrawing, the elongated body shapes and a physiognomy that seems to prefigure that of Van Cleve or Massys suggest that both paintings were executed fairly late, although additional evidence would be required for more precise dating. A characteristic Memling trait is the way the emblematic attributes such as the crucifix, the lion and the cardinal's clothes are included in a natural manner. Taken together, it is like a moment from a story, despite the fact that the depicted elements refer to different periods of the saint's life. Furthermore, the crucifix consists of a genuine flesh-and-blood little body, put to death in miniature, with no attempt on the artist's part to portray it as a vision.We do not know whether the panel was autonomous, or whether it had wings or a companion piece. The small fragment depicting St Jerome and the Lion might have formed part of the left wing (private collection)	MEMLING, Hans	St Jerome	Oil on oak panel, 87,8 x 59,2 cm	1485-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
30937-stillif1.jpg	The drawings of fruits, vegetables and flowers, done in oil on prepared paper, are part of an extraordinary cache of drawings acquired by the Musei Civici of Milan in 1924 from the local church of Santa Maria presso San Celso. They were attributed to the workshop of Simone Peterzano, because many of the drawings in the group are demonstrably by him, and because in subject matter they seemed appropriate to the activity of the workshop. However, the more than two thousand five hundred drawings are enormously varied in style and date. Approximately one thousand have had a traditional association with Peterzano's workshop.

18747-guard213.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself.	GUARDI, Francesco	The Coronation of the Doge	Oil on canvas, 66 x 101 cm	1766-70	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

00370-5battle.jpg	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.

It was not merely a fashion in Hungary to follow the current Romantic Movement that originated in Paris, or the ""historism"" of the Munich and Vienna Academies; it went much deeper than that. At the defeat of the fight for independence, the nation escaped into its history. Along with Hungarian poets and writers, the painters recalled the glorious events of the past, searching for ideals of patriotism and heroism that had not been crushed by despotism.Viktor Madarász gained the first international appreciation for Hungarian painting when his picture, ""The Bewailing of László Hunyadi"" won the State Grand Prix at the 1861 Paris Salon Exhibition. This rather romantic historical painting of the Hunyadi tragedy epitomizes the national grief of the 1850s, and fans the fire of revenge. The dead body of the heroic László Hunyadi, son of the great János Hunyadi, lies in Buda Castle Chapel. King László V, fearing for throne, had lured the popular young Hunyadi to his place with a promise of safe passage. Then he seized him and had him beheaded in the market place at Buda on March 16, 1457. At the feet of body, his mother, Erzsébet Szilágyi, and his bride, Mária Gara, kneel in grief"	MADARÁSZ, Viktor	László Hunyadi on the Bier	Oil on canvas, 249 x 313 cm	1859	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

14906-early08.jpg	By 1883, and as a direct result of the collapse of the stock market the previous year, Gauguin's finances were in disarray, and he began to consider a change in career. This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.The subject of a snowy landscape was a typical Impressionist device to enable the artist to study the effects of colour reflections on a white surface and was particularly favoured by Sisley. However, the handling in the sky and the foliage is more reminiscent of the work of Monet from this period. The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting. This means that the two women were added later, and demonstrates that even at this date Gauguin did not feel tied to working solely from nature, and had already begun to use the subject of two conversing women which was to recur in his mature work	GAUGUIN, Paul	The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel	Oil on canvas, 117 x 90 cm	1883	landscape	French	1851-1900

41126-2bishop.jpg	This panels belongs to a group of altarpiece fragments with scenes devoted to the life of St Clare. Other panels are in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, and in the Historisches Museum, Bamberg. They are thought to belong to two or more dismembered altarpieces. The painter of the panels was influenced primarily by illuminated manuscripts	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	The Bishop of Assisi, Accompanied by St Francis, Handing a Palm to St Clare	Oil, gold, and silver on oak panel, 34 x 22 cm	c. 1360	religious	German	1351-1400
00195-5verospi.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was the loggia of the Villa Farnesina, painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese, from Reni's Aurora and Guercino's Aurora are also present	ALBANI, Francesco	Ceiling vault of piano nobile loggia	Fresco	1611-12	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

00957-03prede2.jpg	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes	ANGELICO, Fra	The Naming of St John the Baptist	Tempera and gold on panel, 26 x 24 cm	1434-35	religious	Italian	1401-1450
25051-double1.jpg	This double-sided panel once formed the wing of a now lost altarpiece, with the Adoration of the Magi originally serving as the interior panel and the Throne of Grace as the exterior. Formerly, the panel was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The style of this master and his workshop was greatly influenced by Flemish painters, in particular, Hugo van der Goes, whose Monforte Altarpiece may be seen as a direct inspiration for the individual figures in this work (particularly the second kneeling King in the Adoration). Furthermore, the picture is indicative of the influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on the group of Cologne painters working at the turn of the 16th century. Such influence on the present work can be seen in Rogier's Columba Altarpiece, which utilizes a similar spatial construction and figural arrangement found in the Adoration here	MASTER of the Holy Kinship	The Adoration of the Magi	Oil on panel, 116 x 86 cm	1510s	religious	German	1501-1550

26143-37frag1.jpg	A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm	MEMLING, Hans	Donor	Oil on oak panel, 45 x 32 cm	c. 1490	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

19818-portrai1.jpg	The two panels in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, representing the portraits of a man and a woman, reveal the artist's interest in depicting the physical characteristics of his sitters, both of whom have rather pronounced features. Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife. However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned. It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses	HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on panel, 24 x 17 cm	1518-20	portrait	German	1451-1500
23076-3washin.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church.In this scene the painter makes skillful use of the obstacle represented by the arch on the wall to produce a scene split into two levels. The lively dialog between Christ and the apostle conveys a sense of movement that embrace all the other figures	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Washing of the Feet	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350
41411-18chape1.jpg	The two frescoes (Crucifixion and The Virgin and Donor) from the oratory of Mocchirolo constitute one of the most interesting and complete examples of the spreading influence of Tuscan art in northern Italy during the late fourteenth century. Count Porro, who commissioned the decoration of the oratory, is shown kneeling before the Madonna in The Virgin and Donor. Controlled and contained in feeling, the dramatic aspects of the tragedy of the Crucifixion are expressed in the noble pathos of the swooning Madonna. To maintain the equilibrium of the composition, the outward movement of her body is countered by the angels in flight and the columnar figure of St John.The modeling of the figures, achieved through gradations of intense colour, complements the measured narrative rhythm. In the portraits of the donors (members of the Porro family) on the walls, and in the figure of St Catherine, the drawing is light and precise. In both paintings the roseate colour is laid on in thin, transparent brushstrokes, and the tenuous compositional connections have an elegant subtlety	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Crucifixion	Detached fresco, 378 x 277 cm	1370	religious	Italian	1351-1400

26248-magdalen.jpg	Anton Raphael Mengs painted this picture in 1752 in Rome, and it led to his admittance to the Accademia di San Luca. Later he tackled the subject on numerous occasions, and in very different ways. In this version elegance and an expression of great sensitivity are combined with reminiscences of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century painting, along with echoes of Classicism in the drapery and the landscape.The depiction of Mary Magdalene as a penitent does not appear in the Bible. It was not until the twelfth century that the legend arose of how she withdrew to a cave in Sainte-Baume in Provence in order to do penance after a life of sin	MENGS, Anton Raphael	The Penitent Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 48 x 64 cm	1752	religious	German	1751-1800
32083-underbru.jpg	Along with Giuseppe Recco and Giovan Battista Ruoppolo, Paolo Porpora was one of the leading figures in Neapolitan still-life painting during the Baroque. In his first period in Naples he painted fish and kitchen still-lifes in great variety. In the late 1640s he moved to Rome and, after coming into contact with the Northern European masters Matthias Withoos and Otto Marseus van Schrieck, active in the city at that time, he began to produce his famous underbrush paintings. The painting in Nancy is one of the few examples of these works that remained	PORPORA, Paolo	Underbrush with Tortoise and Crab	Oil on canvas, 61 x 76 cm	1650-55	portrait	Italian	1651-1700
19902-01henry8.jpg	Henry VIII (1491-1547), king of England (1509-47), who presided over the beginnings of the English Renaissance and the English Reformation. His six wives were, successively, Catherine of Aragon (the mother of the future queen Mary I), Anne Boleyn (the mother of the future queen Elizabeth I), Jane Seymour (the mother of Henry's successor, Edward VI), Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr.This portrait is the only surviving individual portrait of Henry that Holbein himself painted. In terms of features, it corresponds largely to the figure in the Whitehall cartoon. Both portraits are likely to have been based on a single, now lost portrait study by Holbein. However, as a consequence of the small format of the panel painting, the heavy shoulder chain that the king wears in the monumental portrait is omitted here, and his sleeves are embroidered with a very delicate gold thread.This is the quintessential image of the overbearing and tyrannous monarch, from the year the dissolution of the monasteries (and the consequent appropriation of their wealth for the Crown and its servants) was instigated. Holbein depicts the King at `face value', without flattery, emphasizing the small, humourless eyes and mouth, the curiously flat cheeks and chin. Henry's bulky and capricious authority haunts the work despite its small size. Its condensation of magnificence run riot here takes the form of real gold used in the chain, jewellery and collar.The portrait is undoubtedly a tour de force; after its execution, Holbein's position at the court seems to have been secure, and he was used as a painter-ambassador when the King's marital plans unraveled in the late 1530s. Only his misleading portrayal of Anne of Cleves would check his popularity.The subsequent spawning of similar but less effective portraits of the king by Holbein's followers has tended to obscure the compelling mixture of simplicity and realism displayed in this design - the tilt and curve of the black and white hat, the fearful symmetry of the jewelled jacket and the modelling of the hands: imitators often managed either simplicity or realism but never both.

37795-3east1.jpg	The picture shows two scenes in the upper register of the east wall. Scene 7 (left) depicts when St Benedict departs the monastery of Vicovaro. Benedict explains to the monks that his way of life is not compatible with theirs, and he leaves them to return to Subiaco.Scene 8 (right) depicts when St Benedict accepts Maurus and Placidus as disciples. More and more followers gather around Benedict and he is soon able to establish twelve monasteries, but also to keep disciples with him for better instruction in the spiritual life. Maurus and Placidus are two such disciples, both of whom come from distinguished Roman families	SPINELLO ARETINO	Two scenes on the east wall	Fresco	1388	religious	Italian	1351-1400
03287-1assunta.jpg	Around 1475, Bartolomeo della Gatta painted this picture for the Benedictine Church of the Contesse in Cortona. It can be considered his masterpiece because it reaches a degree of lyricism only achieved previously by Piero della Francesca.The painting was moved into the Church of St Dominic in 1788 where the Servants of Mary, who used to run the church, repainted the two Benedictine saints in the foreground, St Benedict and St Scolastica, transforming them into Filippo Benizzi and Giuliana Falconeri, two saints of their religious order. recent restoration has returned the painting to its original beauty and has also removed a group of angels added in the eighteenth century	BARTOLOMEO DELLA GATTA	The Lady of the Assumption Gives St Thomas Her Belt	Tempera on panel, 317 x 221 cm	c. 1475	religious	Italian	1451-1500

17299-selfpo26.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 522, JH 1356.Shortly before he left Paris and moved to Provence in late February 1888, van Gogh painted this final self-portrait. He is no longer dressed as the urban dandy, but in the blue blouson of the Parisian working class. He stands before his easel, holding his palette in a pose intentionally reminiscent of a self-portrait by Rembrandt which was then in the Louvre and well known to van Gogh. Perhaps the painting should be read as a kind of manifesto of the new orientation in his conception of himself as an artist and of his work - the intention to remove himself from the city and its bourgeois lifestyle, and the desire to be seen in a Dutch rather than a French tradition. The painting also betrays a growing confidence in himself as an artist: he appears with the insignia of his profession. Greater assurance is also evident in the handling. The earlier extreme experimentation with pure or broken colour and a textured and structuring brushwork has given way to a more controlled and coherent treatment. In the pose he has used, van Gogh evokes Rembrandt; but the painterly treatment and coloration remind us of another seventeenth-century Dutch artist - Frans Hals. The lessons van Gogh had learnt in Antwerp, explored in greater depth throughout the Paris period, are now successfully integrated into his work to produce a distinctive style	GOGH, Vincent van	Self-Portrait in front of the Easel	Oil on canvas, 65 x 51 cm	January 1888, Paris	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
24767-c_thief.jpg	In his Nativity the Master of Flémalle (Robert Campin) proved himself a sensitive painter of landscape, who knew how to portray the atmospheric subtleties of light and air; but he does not always use nature as the background for his compositions. In the Crucified Thief, the one surviving panel of a lost altarpiece, he resorts to the archaic device of a gold background, contrasting its abstraction with the marked individuality of the figures. The thief's face is contorted with pain, and the wounds where the cords have cut into the flesh are rendered in an extraordinarily brutal manner. The Roman soldiers looking on, particularly the one whose curly hair is held back by a white band and who is placing one hand on his heart, are portrayed with a realism that was at that time outstanding	MASTER of Flémalle	The Crucified Thief	Oil on wood, 33 x 92,5 cm	c. 1410	religious	Flemish	1401-1450
23811-4olympi1.jpg	This canvas was the most vociferously decried painting of the 1865 Salon. In fact, Manet has painted it in 1863 but had apparently not dared submit it in 1864. Olympia is another painting packed with allusions to past masterpieces, notably Titian's Venus of Urbino and Goya's Naked Maja. This whole tradition, from the odalisque to the black slave, continues (particularly with Ingres) throughout the nineteenth century, but what was surprising here was the absence of any exoticism, of either period or location, and the portrayal of a modern prostitute.The painting of the period was not at all averse to flowers, and Courbet, Fantin-Latour, and Manet all painted many pictures with flowers in them. Among the best known bunches (this time wrapped in florist's paper, like those that later Degas placed in the hands of his dancers as they took their bow) is the one being presented by a black servant to Olympia	MANET, Edouard	Olympia	Oil on canvas, 131 x 190 cm	1863	portrait	French	1851-1900

A kettle is boiling over the fire, hanging from a chain barely visible in the curling smoke.Van Gogh's Nuenen interiors of peasant women engaged in their work convey a certain timelessness and reflect the influence of 17th-century Dutch genre painting	GOGH, Vincent van	Peasant Woman by the Fireplace	Oil on canvas on panel, 29 x 40 cm	March-April 1885, Nuenen	genre	Dutch	1851-1900
11156-1870s_18.jpg	Horse racing, a sport imported from England, was a novelty at that time. Degas discovered racetracks as a subject for art in the early 1860s. However, he rarely painted the course itself, he preferred to look elsewhere. He was fascinated by preparations for a race, by false starts and the wait before the start, by the tension and the release of tension - all of them moments hardly laden with action	DEGAS, Edgar	Racehorses in Longchamps	Oil on canvas, 34 x 42 cm	c. 1874	other	French	1851-1900

04735-adoratio.jpg	The Catholic painter Abraham, resident in predominantly Catholic Utrecht, painted spectacular altarpieces in the style reminiscent of sixteenth-century Italian painting. He painted this altarpiece, one of his largest, for the church of the Catholic order of the Jesuits in Brussels, in the Southern Netherlands. Such commissions were extremely rare in the Dutch Republic. Bloemaert's jubilant colour and festive pageantry befitted the theme and answered the Jesuit's need for a lively backdrop to their main altar	BLOEMAERT, Abraham	Adoration of the Magi	Oil on canvas, 420 x 290 cm	1623-24	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

03387-stillmus.jpg	"Because he was in holy orders, Baschenis is sometimes referred to as Father Evaristo. The Bergamese Baschenis was, more than anything else, the perfect example of a ""specialist"" painter. In fact nearly all his oeuvre was dedicated to painting musical instruments, sometimes his pictures being finished by other painters who added figures (as in the case of two paintings that have recently been found in the Brera in Milan). From this specific point of view, Baschenis is one of the most fascinating and focused painters of the whole of the seventeenth century. His use of realism and light is reminiscent of Caravaggio. His canvases had an intense quality which was dominated by his exceptional technical ability (one thing that stands out is the way in which he depicted dust on the back of stringed instruments).But Baschenis' work never degenerated into a mere display of virtuoso talent. It was rather directed to convey a sense of almost severe moral purpose. Baschenis' success with still-life gave rise, especially in Bergamo itself, to a real fashion for the genre, with other painters following his example."

18777-guard400.jpg	This painting is a view of the Campo San Zanipolo with the loggia temporarily erected outside the Scuola di San Marco for the benediction of Pope Pius VI on 19 May 1782.In May 1782, Pope Pius VI visited the city of Venice. The ceremonies and festivities on that occasion were recorded by Francesco Guardi in a series of four paintings. The city council commissioned Guardi to make four paintings representing the following subjects: the arrival of the pontiff near San Giorgio in Alga, the papal mass in SS Giovanni e Paolo, the papal audience and the blessing of the people on Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo.On the occasion of the Pope Pius VI blessing the crowd a temporary wooden loggia, designed by Antonio Codognato, was erected on the façade of the Scuola di San Marco. Once the Pope had finished his blessing the crowds were allowed to mount the loggia and the existence of at least three variants of this subject, including the present one, attest to the popularity of the composition	GUARDI, Francesco	View of the Campo San Zanipolo in Venice	Oil on canvas, 62 x 47 cm	1782	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

35578-23gevart.jpg	"This is a portrait of Rubens' friend Jan Gaspar Gevaerts (1593-1666). He was a reputable philologist, Neo-Latin poet and historiographer. Characteristically for his intellectual circles he had his name Latinized to Gevartius.After a stay in Holland and Paris Gevartius became the Registrar of the city of Antwerp. In this function he was in charge of official ceremonies in the city and in 1635 helped Rubens with the ""Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi"", one of Rubens most impressive projects.Rubens here intends to represent his friend's humanist attitude: he is sitting at his desk, with a bust of the Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, on whom he wrote an unpublished commentary. The painting is dated around 1628. The composition of the work is not baroque, but fits more easily into the 16th-century tradition of homely portraits of humanists"	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Portrait of Jan Gaspar Gevartius	Oil on panel, 119 x 98 cm	c. 1628	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
08303-pitti.jpg	The picture shows the south wall of the Salone Terreno (Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) on the ground floor of the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule.

13722-marthama.jpg	In composition and overall approach to subject matter Giovanni Andrea appears to have been influenced by Caravaggio's canvas of the same subject. However, while Caravaggio's composition is underpinned by a complex visual and literal tradition associated with this subject, Giovanni Andrea's interpretation appears to be more closely associated with allegorical genre scenes by Venetian masters, such as Titian or Palma Vecchio. Such influence could only have been transmuted into Giovanni Andrea's work through his most influential master, Bernardo Strozzi.

05533-51lemmi.jpg	The only secular frescoes by Botticelli that still exist were discovered 1873, in the Villa Lemmi, at the foot of the Careggi Hill, close to a villa of Cosimo de Medici. They had been concealed under old coats of paint for centuries. Villa Lemmi belonged to the Tornabuoni family, friend of the Medici. It is possible that the frescoes were commissioned on the occasion of a marriage between members of the Tornabuoni and Albizzi families. For a long time the view was held that the couple in question were Giovanna degli Albizzi and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who married in 1486. This assumption has, however, since been proven wrong, for the face of Giovanna that we know from a medallion does not agree with the lady in Botticell's fresco. A possible alternative could be Nanna Tornabuoni and Matteo degli Albizzi, who married in about 1484.It is supposed the frescoes were executed to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi.The frescoes are in a very poor state of preservation, because they were damaged when taken down from the wall. Two of the three fragments found were transferred to canvas and later sold to the Louvre in Paris. The two compositions were originally separated only by a window.One of the fragments probably  represents Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, the other A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts.On this painting there is a strange lack of certainty as to the identity of the group of four young classically dressed women, who are gracefully stepping towards a young woman in front of the splashing spring in order to bring her gifts.

12957-armour.jpg	During his extended stay in Italy from 1621 to 1627, spending the majority of his time in Genoa, Van Dyck made his mark as a portraitist, and numbered many important families from the upper strata of Genoese society among his clients. It has yet to be clarified whether or not the Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf was one of these commissions; various attempts to identify the man in the picture have been inconclusive. It is also possible that the painting is not a portrait but an allegory	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf	Oil on canvas, 90 x 70 cm	1625-27	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

11273-207delac.jpg	Delacroix's grandest pictures have never left their country of origin. Only in Paris can we fully appreciate the bold reconciliation of beauty with cruelty, sensuality with control, fantasy with observation, modernity with tradition that characterises the art of this influential painter.'As Byron signifies Romantic poetry, so Romantic French art means above all Delacroix. Like Byron he achieved his flamboyant artistic effects through intense intellectual application and a firm grasp of technique. Pupil of an academic artist, he was essentially self-taught through the study of the great Renaissance and seventeenth-century colourists in the Louvre. He was fascinated by the vibrant brushwork of the Venetians and their Flemish heir Rubens, imitating their capacity to simulate brilliant daylight even in the shadows, their use of colour instead of line as the primary structural element. It was precisely these effects which, as employed by Constable in the Hay-Wain exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1824, caused a sensation and further exacerbated Delacroix's fashionable Anglomania. In 1825, having sold his picture of the Massacre of Chios to the French State, he set out for London with two English friends, the watercolourists Richard Bonington and Thales Fielding. They visited galleries and the theatre and read English poets. Delacroix met other English artists, including Thomas Lawrence. Appropriately for a painting in an English collection, the lifesize likeness of Louis-Auguste Schwiter, painted after Delacroix's return to Paris, is an essay in the portrait style of Lawrence.Schwiter, a lifelong friend of Delacroix, was himself a painter. He is presented here, however, as a gentleman, dressed in elegant black and hat in hand, standing on what appears to be the terrace of a great country house, as if waiting to be admitted. The blue Chinese vase with its heavily paint-textured flowers contrasts with the red lining of his hat. Like the trumpet vine clippings on the paving, these touches of colour serve to relate the foreground to the brooding sunset landscape (said to have been painted in part by Paul Huet, another artist friend), thus counteracting the isolation of Schwiter's monochrome silhouette.The portrait is lit from the right, a reversal of the more usual illumination from the left, highlighting the left side of the sitter's face and perhaps helping to account for the curiously tentative impression he gives, despite his firm stance in the centre of the picture and his direct gaze. The unemphatic 'modern' pose, with its hint of English-style reserve, and the free 'unfinished' brushwork made this full-length portrait, at once so formal and so unconventional, unacceptable to the judges of the 1827 Paris Salon exhibition, and it was rejected. Delacroix later reworked the painting, finally completing it in 1830	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	Louis-Auguste Schwiter	Oil on canvas, 218 x 144 cm	1826-27	portrait	French	1801-1850
36111-hercules.jpg	With such paintings as painted tapestry, painting within a painting it became possible to use the flat surface of a ceiling vault for narrative depictions.

42748-buff1.jpg	"Blindman's buff is a children's game played as early as 2,000 years ago in Greece. To play the standard game of blindman's buff, one player is blindfolded and then disoriented by being spun around several times. The other players, who are not blindfolded, amuse themselves by calling out to the ""blind man"" and dodging away from him. In the Middle Ages blindman's buff was an adult game, and the blindfolded player was usually struck and buffeted as well, hence ""buff.""

34842-traveler.jpg	It is said that this Dutch painter in Amsterdam was the friend of Rembrandt. His rocky mountainous landscapes show affinities with Rembrandt as well as traces of the work of his mother's uncle, the Mannerist Roelandt Savery. In 1646-47, when Roghman was nineteen- or twenty-years-old he drew a set of more than 240 large views of Dutch castles, presumably to fulfill a commission. This remarkable set of careful topographical drawings, now widely scattered, has nothing in common with Rembrandt's style. Later, in the 1660s, he was influenced by the topographical scenes produced by Allaert van Everdingen during his trips to Scandinavia	ROGHMAN, Roelandt	Valley with Travellers	Oil on canvas	1660s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
13024-stuarts.jpg	Early in 1639 the two Stuart brothers, cousins of King Charles I and younger sons of the third Duke of Lennox, set off on a three-year tour of the Continent. They must have posed for Van Dyck just before their departure. Since his arrival at the court, the artist had developed a new portrait type: the double portrait recording friendship, often, but not necessarily, between relatives. The two brothers are shown as if poised on the point of departure, waiting perhaps for servants to bring up their carriage. Both were to die a few years later in the Civil War, and hindsight gives the image an added valedictory poignancy.Van Dyck's compositional skill is surpassed only by his matchless ability to depict satin, lace and meltingly-soft kid leather. But these carefully described effects are somehow not local: the whole surface of the canvas is brought alive with a flickering touch. The costumes, so fashionably similar, are beautifully contrasted - receding warm gold and brown on Lord John, cooler and advancing silver and blue on Lord Bernard - so that the two brothers, complementing each other in apparel, seem to form one shimmering, indivisible whole	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Lord John and Lord Bernard Stuart	Oil on canvas, 238 x 146 cm	c. 1638	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
07499-271y_ram.jpg	This painting exists in two versions, both of which are probably by Caravaggio (who frequently copied his own paintings). Both versions are in Rome, the other in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.The image is a masterpiece of virtuosity whose appeal lies in its soft, caressing light and velvety rendering of cloth, flesh, and plants. The figure is identifiable as St John only virtue of the symbols of Christ displayed in the painting: the ram (sacrificial victim), and the grape-leaves (from whose red juice, akin to the blood of Christ, springs life); otherwise the iconographical subject (the simple, immediately apparent image) appears as a nude youth with an ironic, if not allusive, expression. Its cultivated content and its destination for an aristocratic patron are underscored by the artist's explicit use of a great figurative source of the past: Michelangelo's Ignudi from the Sistine Ceiling. But whereas Michelangelo created abstract and ideal figures with cold lights and a merely theoretical plasticism, Caravaggio models his figure on the careful observation of nature, achieving an image of perfect realism	CARAVAGGIO	St John the Baptist (Youth with Ram)	Oil on canvas, 129 x 94 cm	1602	religious	Italian	1551-1600
13770-hero_lea.jpg	According to legend, Leander, a youth of Abydos, a town on the Asian shore of the Hellespont, used to swim across the waters at night to Sestos on the opposite side to meet his lover Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite. She would guide him by holding up a lighted torch. One stormy night Leander was drowned. Hero in her despair threw herself into the sea. The story is related in this form by the Greek poet Museus (4th-5th cent. A.D.). Ovid tells of the lovers, omitting their death. The theme is found in Italian and Netherlandish painting, especially of the 17th century: the drowned Oleander is borne away by Needs as Hero plunges to her death into the sea	FETTI, Domenico	Hero and Leander	Oil on wood, 42 x 96 cm	1622-23	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
18745-guard211.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself	GUARDI, Francesco	The Doge at the Basilica of La Salute	Oil on canvas, 68 x 100 cm	1766-70	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

They are among the finest examples of court portraiture ever painted. This picture represents Infanta Margarita, born on 12 July 1651, daughter of Philip IV and his second wife, Mariana.

The predella paintings are copies, the originals are in the Musée du Louvre and in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Tours.Despite the framing elements that divide them, the three main panels of the San Zeno Altarpiece form an unified picture space. The central section depicts the Madonna holding her Child and surrounded by music-making angels, seated on a marble throne decorated with Roman-inspired reliefs. The naturalistic trompe l'oeil garlands, seemingly affixed to the top of the picture, create a rapport with the garlands held by the putti in the marble relief at the top of the throne. The borderline between the real world and the invented world here breaks down completely	MANTEGNA, Andrea	San Zeno Polyptych	Tempera on panel, 480 x 450 cm	1457-60	religious	Italian	1451-1500
26350-portarti.jpg	Dressed in their finery the couple sit side by side in a room, which is revealed by numerous items and the woman at the blackboard to be in a tavern. The man and his wife are illuminated by an unseen light source from the front left. The man is laughing and puts his left arm around the young woman's shoulders, a gesture echoed by her arm as she hands him some berries. He raises a flute glass in his right hand to her health, while she looks straight ahead rather stiffly. Beside the couple a table is laid with a silver pot, some dried fish and a small loaf of bread, but the way it has been truncated at one end gives it the look of a stage prop. The rear of the tavern is in shadow, so that all that may be distinguished is the incidental figure chalking up orders in front of the fireplace, a narrow shelf, and an empty birdcage hanging above. The room opens up to the rear at the right, giving a view of a sunny courtyard in which a market stall has been erected.Although the painting was for many years known simply as The Lovers at Breakfast, the two protagonists, quite different in type, have been identified as the artist and Isabella de Wolff, whom he married in 1658 and who was a niece of the painter Pieter de Grebber.The iconography of the painting distinguishes it as part of a painting tradition well-known to the educated contemporary viewer: the carousing, feasting couple, the ambience of the tavern with the landlady at the blackboard, the highly significant bread and fish still-life on the table. All of these elements point to the subject of the 'prodigal son regaling with the harlots in the inn'. This Biblical parable, much loved and widespread in seventeenth-century Dutch painting, was understood as an admonition against a life of sin and vice. A link between the Biblical story and an artist's self-portrait was not, however, completely unusual. Rembrandt, for instance, had depicted himself in a similar pose some twenty years earlier, in his Self-portrait with Saskia in the Scene from the Prodigal Son, which is also in the Dresden collection	METSU, Gabriel	Portrait of the Artist with His Wife Isabella de Wolff in a Tavern	Oil on oak panel, 36 x 31 cm	1661	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700

23116-10carme5.jpg	This painting formed a panel of the predella of the dismembered altarpiece in the Carmelite church San Niccol&#242; al Carmine in Siena. The five scenes in the predella depict events in the history of the Carmelite Order: The Annunciation to Sobac, Hermits at the Fountain of Elijah, St Albert Presents the Rule to the Carmelites, The Pope Issues a Bull to a Carmelite Delegation, and The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV.The long central predella and the next two scenes represent the modern documented history of the Carmelite Order. Some time between 1206 and 1214, Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem, traveled to Mount Carmel an presented the hermits with a Rule. The Rule was accepted by Pope Honorius III in 1226 with a papal bull. A further papal dispensation allowed for the alteration of the Carmelite habit, exchanging the black and white horizontally striped outer cape for a simple white one	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Predella panel: The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV	Tempera on wood	1328-29	religious	Italian	1301-1350

10147-42religi.jpg	Signed at bottom left with a winged serpent, the artist's sign.The works of Lucas Cranach the Elder are as varied and full of incident as was his career as an artist. As a young man, he lived and worked in Vienna from 1500 to 1503, the period when he came in contact with the Danube School, whose development was much influenced by his own work. After 1505 he worked as court painter to Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony in Wittenberg, and in this citadel of the German Reformation he established and directed a large and busy workshop. In addition to altarpieces and religious pictures he painted mythological subjects, genre scenes and portraits, as well as executed a considerable body of graphic work.The black wall on the left side of this painting is the result of a later repainting, presumably a curtain was there originally.

05197-09folly.jpg	"In the midst of a luxuriant summer landscape, a surgeon removes an object from the head of a man tied to a chair; a monk and a nun look on. This little picture may not be entirely by Bosch; the awkward and inexpressive figures are perhaps by an inferior hand, but only Bosch could have been responsible for the landscape background whose delicately painted forms recall the vista in his early Epiphany. The open-air operation, its circular shape suggesting a mirror, is set within a framework of elaborate calligraphical decoration containing the inscription: ""Master, cut the stone out, my name is Lubbert Das.""In Bosch's day, the stone operation was a piece of quackery in which the patient was supposedly cured of his stupidity through the removal of the stone of folly from his forehead. Fortunately, it was performed only in fiction, not in fact, for in literary examples of this theme it generally left the patient worse off than before. The name ""Lubbert"", on the other hand, frequently appears in Dutch literature to designate persons exhibiting an unusually high degree of human stupidity. The stone operation was occasionally represented by later Netherlandish artists, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This subject undoubtedly inspired Bosch's picture, but no extant version of it accounts for the funnel and the book perched on the heads of two of the characters, nor does it explain the presence of the monk and the nun, although their apparent acquiescence in the quackery certainly places them in an unfavourable light. It will be noted, too, that what the surgeon extracts from Lubbert's head is not a stone, but a flower; another flower of the same species lies on the table at the right. The flowers has identified as tulips and their presence is explained as a play on the Dutch word for tulip which in the sixteenth century also carried the connotation of stupidity and folly."

Beginning in c. 1450, he built a castle for his mistress, Bianca Pellegrini, and named it after her, Roccabianca. Here was a room that was completely painted between 1458 and 1464. The subject of the cycle was the famous Griselda from one of the novellas in Boccaccio's Decameron, a story frequently illustrated in fifteenth-century painting, especially on wedding chests (cassoni). The paintings in the Stanza di Griselda (now in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan) comprise twenty-four monochrome picture compartments divided into two registers. There is also an astrological program on the vaulted ceiling.The paintings were executed by an unknown painter working in the manner of Niccol&#242; da Varallo (1420-1489)	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Picture cycle from the Stanza di Griselda	Fresco	1458-64	mythological	Italian	1451-1500

39592-2pesaro0.jpg	Titian was neither such a universal scholar as Leonardo, nor such an outstanding personality as Michelangelo, nor such a versatile and attractive man as Raphael. He was principally a painter, but a painter whose handling of paint equalled Michelangelo's mastery of draughtsmanship. This supreme skill enabled him to disregard all the time-honoured rules of composition, and to rely on colour to restore the unity which he apparently broke up.We need but look at Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family which was begun only some fifteen years after Giovanni Bellini's Madonna with saints to realize the effect which his art must have had on contemporaries. It was almost unheard of to move the Holy Virgin out of the centre of the picture, and to place the two administering saints - St Francis, who is recognizable by the Stigmata (the wounds of the Cross), and St Peter, who has deposited the key (emblem of his dignity) on the steps of the Virgin's throne - not symmetrically on each side, as Giovanni Bellini had done, but as active participants of a scene.In this altar-painting, Titian had to revive the tradition of donors' portraits, but did it in an entirely novel way. The picture was intended as a token of thanksgiving for a victory over the Turks by the Venetian nobleman Jacopo Pesaro, and Titian portrayed him kneeling before the Virgin while an armoured standard-bearer drags a Turkish prisoner behind him. St Peter and the Virgin look down on him benignly while St Francis, on the other side, draws the attention of the Christ Child to the other members of the Pesaro family, who are kneeling in the corner of the picture. The whole scene seems to take place in an open courtyard, with two giant columns which rise into the clouds where two little angels are playfully engaged in raising the Cross.Titian's contemporaries may well have been amazed at the audacity with which he had dared to upset the old-established rules of composition. They must have expected, at first, to find such a picture lopsided and unbalanced. Actually it is the opposite. The unexpected composition only serves to make it gay and lively without upsetting the harmony of it all. The main reason is the way in which Titian contrived to let light, air and colours unify the scene. The idea of making a mere flag counterbalance the figure of the Holy Virgin would probably have shocked an earlier generation, but this flag, in its rich, warm colour, is such a stupendous piece of painting that the venture was a complete success.

Behind Him are placed four figures in front of a flat and undefined background of a striking red, which is decorated with a printed black design of curving tendrils. The artist's technical skill is evident in the transparency of the haloes, which are subtly painted as if they were fine lace. Notable are the modelling of the hands and faces, and the lyrical poses of the Virgin and Child and the background figures	FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI	Virgin and Child with St Catherine and Angels	Mixed technique on panel, 62 x 42 cm	c. 1490	religious	Italian	1451-1500
33958-sebasti1.jpg	During his career Reni and his workshop produced two types of images of St Sebastian, which exist in various versions. The first type, from around 1615, exists in the autograph work now in the Musei di Strada Nuova, Palazzo Rosso in Genoa. Reni returned to the subject around 1616-17, with a different, larger composition. Many versions exist of this work, the painting in the Dulwich Gallery, London, is most likely the original and first one.Powerfully Caravaggesque in its dramatic chiaroscuro, Reni's Sebastian is shown as a striking nude, indebted in its form to antique sculpture and to the classicism of the Bolognese school of the Carracc	RENI, Guido	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas, 170 x 130 cm	1617-18	religious	Italian	1601-1650

37527-2farnes2.jpg	Chigi's bedchamber was adjacent to the banquet hall, and he had Sodoma decorate two of its wall, probably in conjunction with the decoration of the hall. The surfaces of the walls open up onto a narrative with large-scale figures, as if inviting visitors to enter. In the painting on the wall to the right, the women of Darius's family approach the Macedonian ruler. Sisigambis, the mother of the defeated Persian ruler, initially mistook Hephaistion for Alexander, but the true ruler inclines graciously toward her. The painter revels in his depiction of female grace, pushing the female bodies close together before Alexander and the viewer. The forms on the left also repeat the triad of goddesses, Venus, Ceres, and Juno from Raphael's spandrel in the Loggia di Psiche. The smithy scene along the base of the wall alludes to the love themes and to the fireplace	SODOMA, Il	The Women of Darius's Family before Alexander the Great	Fresco	c. 1517	historical	Italian	1501-1550
39821-17strada.jpg	In the final period, which saw Titian focussing his attention on religious themes, he still found the energy to paint portraits. Between 1567 and 1568 he produced two of his greatest masterpieces in this field: the Prado Self-Portrait and the Portrait of Jacopo Strada in Vienna.The portrait of the well-known antiquarian Jacopo Strada, one of the most famous of Titian's late portraits, represents Jacopo Strada, an expert of antiquities as presenting a small Venus statue. On the table there are some objects, among them a letter addressed to Titian. The decorative frame with the inscription is a later addition from the workshop of Titian.The painting is of the very highest quality. It is painted in energetic dabs of brown and ochre yellow, offset by the black velvet jerkin with a silver fox fur flung around the shoulders. The careful depiction of the details which allude to the profession of the sitter (the statuette, the coins, the cartouche and the books) do not distract from the characterization of Strada, who is looking enquiringly at someone outside the painting	TIZIANO Vecellio	Portrait of Jacopo Strada	Oil on canvas, 125 x 95 cm	1567-68	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
05692-sun1.jpg	The companion piece The Setting of the Sun is also in the Wallace Collection.These extravagant and wonderful pictures show Apollo as God of the Sun leaving Tethys with her Nereids and Tritons in the river Ocean as he drives up the morning sun in his chariot drawn by four white horses, and then returning to her at nightfall.

31453-3saints1.jpg	The decorative skills of Pinturichio are apparent in the vault of this room he painted in the papal apartments of the Vatican. He accentuated the ribs of the vault and in doing so created strong framing elements within which he placed the scenes of the vault. Pinturichio filled all of the available surface with imagery, reserving the direct centre of the ceiling for the Borgia coat of arms. A later pope, Julius II, found serious objection to the decoration, and refused to live in the apartments.The frescoes depict the myth of Isis and Osiris	PINTURICCHIO	Vault decoration	Fresco	1493-95	other	Italian	1451-1500
39585-1assunt1.jpg	"Titian worked on this huge altarpiece for more than two years from 1516 to 1518. It has to be seen as a milestone in Titian's career establishing him as a more universal artist who drew inspiration from outside the confines of Venice. Indeed the powerful figures of the Apostles reflect the influence of Michelangelo, whereas the painting demonstrates clear iconographical similarities with the works of Raphael. Above all, what emerges most strongly in the assumption is Titian's desire to break definitely with the traditions of Venetian painting in order to arrive at a synthesis of dramatic force and dynamic tension which will become from this moment on the most obvious characteristic of his work.The picture is composed of three orders. At the bottom are the Apostles (humanity), amazed and stunned by the wondreous happening. St Peter is kneeling with his hand on his breast, St Thomas is pointing at the Virgin, and St Andrew in a red cloak is stretching forward. In the middle, the madonna, slight and bathed in light, is surrounded by by a host of angels that accompany her joyfully hailing. Above is the Eternal Father, serene and noble majesty, calling the Virgin to him with a look of love.The painting is signed as ""Ticianus"" low down in the middle of the picture"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on wood, 690 x 360 cm	1516-18	religious	Italian	1501-1550

43540-anselmus.jpg	Family harmony is a source of prosperity and happiness. So proclaims the Latin inscription in the cartouche at the top of the picture. This is the message of this family portrait, which does much more than simply depict wealthy members of Antwerp high society. Antonius Anselmus, an alderman of the city from 1580 to 1582, and his wife Joanna Hooftmans, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, are placed in front of a neutral background, accompanied by their two children, both born in Antwerp, Gillis in 1575 and Joanna in 1576. A third child was to be born in Hamburg, where the family sought refuge for a time after the city of Antwerp was returned to the Catholics. The Anselmus family, like the Hooftmans, were Calvinists.The family's high social ranking is immediately visible in the various items of decor: the carved furniture, the silver inkwell on the table, and the fragile Venetian glass vase, as well as the costly lace on the parents' garments and the children's aprons. The little girl holds a sumptuous vermeil rattle, a prestigious object symbolising the wealth of the newly born child. This object was offered to very young children by a godfather or an important person. The one represented here has at one end a whistle and at the other a wolf's tooth, to which popular belief attributed the double power of protecting children against the evil eye and reducing teething pain. On the table between the couple are the marriage gloves and a rose, symbols of the love that unites them. The children express the prosperity of the couple as does the fruit being held by the elder. At the same time the tame bird on his shoulder is a metaphor for a successful education.Maerten de Vos, who excelled in the portrait genre, was also known for his religious paintings, producing, among other works, six paintings of episodes from the life of St Paul for the dining room of Gillis Hooftmans, Joanna's father. It is possibly following this commission that he painted the family portrait. By creating a unified and enveloping space around the figures, the artist succeeded in given a new dimension to the genre, intensifying both the psychological study and the allegorical significance.

24069-3sposi01.jpg	The tent-like vaulting of the Camera degli Sposi contains: in the centre the trompe-l'oeil oculus; in the diamond-shaped compartments eight busts of emperors in medallions; in the side vaults scenes from the myths of Orpheus, Arion, and Hercules.Although painted first, the painting of the ceiling, done in grisaille and imitation gold mosaics, is meant to be the logical continuation of the vertical arrangements of the space. It represents a tent-like roof with pointed vaults above the walls; the painting makes it appear higher than it actually is. Broad groins ornamented with meanders rise up from the painted basket capitals, dividing the ceiling into eight lozenge-shaped fields drawn to sharp points at the bottom, like spandrels. Each lozenge contains a round medallion in which depicted are the first eight Roman emperors. The twelve triangular vaults above the lunettes contain scenes from classical myth and legend, all backed by gold mosaics.

The predella panels were from the left to the right, according to a nineteenth-century drawing attributed to Humbert de Superville, the following:The Last Supper (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York),The Betrayal of Christ (National Gallery, London),The Flagellation (Staatliche Museen, Berlin),The Way to Calvary (National Gallery, London),The Deposition (National Gallery, London),The Entombment (Staatliche Museen, Berlin),The Resurrection (National Gallery, London).In the predella scenes, the iconography is based very closely on the equivalent scene in Duccio's Maest&#224; for Siena Cathedral	UGOLINO DI NERIO	The Resurrection	Egg tempera on wood, 42 x 58 cm	1325-28	religious	Italian	1301-1350
09052-sunshine.jpg	As a result of their approach to Impressionism, Belgian artists occasionally juxtaposed native Flemish styles with imported Impressionist styles derived from the French. One of the major exponents of the more French-oriented line was Emile Claus, who painted in the style of Monet. Paintings such as Sunshine and A Corner of My Garden show how intensely he grappled with the phenomenon of light and different atmospheric conditions. His subjects, frequently landscapes, recall Monet	CLAUS, Emile	Sunshine	Oil on canvas, 81 x 117 cm	1899	landscape	Belgian	1851-1900

08082-gondola.jpg	In this painting Carus also shows the figures from behind, so that the viewer experiences the boat trip. At the same time the boat is framed like a vista from the window, creating a picture within a picture..

32349-17ignazi.jpg	The effect of the simulated cupola rests largely on the figural groupings on the pendentives, which were executed immediately after the canvas with the painted cupola was put in place. Painted on actual concave pendentives, they make the sham cupola more believable, especially when viewed from the entrance. The monumental figures (Judith, David, Samson, Jael) have an imposing physicality, emphasized by their bright colours and strong contrasts	POZZO, Andrea	Painting on the pendentive: Samson	Fresco	1685	religious	Italian	1651-1700
35839-valkhof1.jpg	The picture shows the Valkhof at Nijmegen with a ferry crossing the river Waal. The site of the medieval Valkhof, the fortress built on Roman foundations that dominates the city, was and indeed still is dramatic, towering over a bend in the river.

07635-89d_stil.jpg	The attribution of this still-life to Caravaggio is doubtful.From a thematic point of view, large scale still-lifes in the Galleria Borghese are similar to outstanding early works by Caravaggio, but they lack the brilliance and the concentration on individual objects. This painting and another are usually attributed to Caravaggio. Because it is rather unconvincing to attribute such work to Caravaggio, some scholars distinguish this Caravaggesque painter of still-lifes from the master by naming him - after a splendid example of the genre - the Painter of the Still-Life in the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford.

17237-5portra5.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 541, JH 1893.Working from the large-format portrait drawing that Gauguin left in Arles at the end of December 1888, van Gogh returned to the subject of the Arlésienne in January 1890, simultaneously drawing on his reinterpretation of Madame Ginoux with Books of 1888 (F 488). As yet untitled in the painting of that year, the books accompanying Madame Ginoux in subsequent variant all bear the same two titles: Harriet Beecher-Stove's Uncle Tom's Cabin and Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.Four of the five original variants of the portrait survived, they are in the Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Rome, in the Museu de Arte, S&#227;o Paulo, and in a private collection	GOGH, Vincent van	L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux)	Oil on canvas, 65 x 49 cm	February 1890, Saint-Rémy	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
35952-4amster1.jpg	Genre painting in Holland embraced all areas of life: scenes from daily life, domestic interiors, still-lifes, seascapes, landscapes, architectural views and urban scenes. The Dutch were proud of their nation and its many different faces, and genre paintings were in great demand amongst the middle and upper classes. Like many artists, Saenredam chose to specialize - in his case, in paintings of architecture ranging from urban views and famous buildings to church interiors	SAENREDAM, Pieter Jansz	The Old Town Hall in Amsterdam	Oil on panel, 65 x 85 cm	1657	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
10998-307david.jpg	When David was released from the Luxembourg prison at the end of December 1794, he became ill and so requested permission from the Convention to visit his wife's sister and her husband, Emilie and Pierre Sériziat, at their country house in Saint Ouen, near Tournan-en-Brie, about 32 km (20 miles) east of Paris. This visit was cut short by the accusations of May 1795 and arrest, but he returned there, accompanied by a guard, to recuperate after his second and final release in August. He then painted the portraits of his hosts. Madame Sériziat is shown in an interior setting with her young son, having just returned from a walk. Her cheeks are ruddy and she carries a recently picked bunch of wild flowers which are painted in a lively but meticulous manner.These two portraits were testaments of friendship and, by showing them at the 1795 Salon, he could prove that he was still able to paint after his ordeals	DAVID, Jacques-Louis	Portrait of Emilie Sériziat and her Son	Oil on canvas, 131 x 96 cm	1795	portrait	French	1801-1850

In the right background a satyr hands a piece of fruit to a nymph, while on the right two satyrs and two nymphs return from the hunt.

05288-2lastjud.jpg	The left wing of the triptych represents the Paradise.Here, across the three inner panels, appear the First and Last Things, beginning with the Fall of Man on the left wing.The story recounted in the second and third chapters of Genesis has been placed in a lush garden; in the foreground we see the creation of Eve, followed by the temptation of the First Couple. In the middle distance they are driven from the garden by an angel. The expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden is paralleled above by the expulsion from Heaven of the Rebel Angels, who are transformed into monsters as they descend to earth. Although the revolt of proud Lucifer and his followers is not mentioned in Genesis, it appears in Jewish legends and entered Christian doctrine at an early age. These were the angels who sinned and whose prince, envying Adam, caused him to sin in turn. It was further believed that Adam and Eve had been created by God in order that their offspring might fill the places left vacant by the fallen angels. In this panel, Bosch thus depicted the entrance of sin into the world and accounted for the necessity of the Last Judgment.The inclusion of the Fall of Adam and Eve in a representation of the Last Judgment is unusual; the other two panels of the Vienna triptych depart even more from traditional iconography	BOSCH, Hieronymus	Last Judgment Triptych (left wing)	Mixed technique on panel, 167 x 60 cm	1504-08	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

18706-4sacrif.jpg	Girolamo Godi, organizer of a Vicenzan literary salon and friend of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, engaged Gualtiero around 1550 to decorate the villa. In addition to the loggia, the decoration of four rooms in the right wing of the villa can be ascribed to Gualtiero: the Hall of the Gods or the Putto, the Hall of the Triumphs, the Hall of the Caesars, and the Hall of the Sacrifices. Gualtiero's sudden death in 1552 prevented him from completing the work which was taken over by Battista Zelotti and Battista del Moro, who created the frescoes in the other rooms.In the Hall of the Sacrifices allegorical figures ornament the walls.

12961-cardinal.jpg	Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio (1579-1644), an Italian cardinal, statesman and historian, commissioned this portrait of himself. As papal nuncio, he had work for peace between the Catholics and the Protestants in Flanders, and the Catholics and the French Protestants (the Huguenots) in France. Van Dyck, refining the robust style of his master, Rubens, specialized in long, sensitive fingers and the lush treatment of fabrics - note the sitter's moiré robe	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio	Oil on canvas, 195 x 147 cm	c. 1625	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
20876-woman.jpg	This painting, depicting a woman pulling water from a well, a pile of vegetables at her feet, is an example of Kalf's Parisian period. The outstanding feature of the painting is the pile of vegetables at the woman's feet, a still-life within a larger genre scene. This corner of the work hints at the skill and precision that characterise the dedicated still-lifes, which Kalf painted later in his career	KALF, Willem	Woman Pulling Water from a Well	Oil on copper, 27 x 22 cm	c. 1645	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
32074-piacenza.jpg	The decoration was executed by Pordenone and Bernardino Gatti.Domes, which vault the crossing and altar of countless churches, lend themselves well to being transformed into paintings of the sky. The round shape above our heads seems to  open onto a higher world, so that God and the things of heaven become visually present at the church holiest spot.Astonishing dynamic effects in dome decorations were achieved by Pordenone. In the large ribbed dome of Santa Madonna di Campagna in Piacenza, in 1530-32, Pordenone began to fresco a complex theological program. God the Father floats in the cupola, mysteriously illuminated by invisible windows. Putti, animals, and illusionistic reliefs of Old Testament stories decorate the ribs. In between them heroic sibyls, prophets, and other Old Testament figures are seen against views of the heavens. In 1543 Bernardino Gatti added apostles on the pilasters of the drum below, stories from the life of Mary on the next level, and finally evangelists on the pendentives	PORDENONE	Decoration of the main dome	Fresco	1530-32	religious	Italian	1501-1550
42101-19studi2.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments. Two doors, not distinguished in any way from the cupboard doors, cover the only windows: Francesco preferred to work by candlelight.The intimate scale of the project allowed Vasari and his pupils to develop their imaginative abilities, technical skill, and jewel-like delicacy of colour. Eight sculptors made the bronze statuettes, and the paintings were by twenty-four artists.

12539-07docto.jpg	At the same time as the Feast of the Rose Garlands, Dürer was working on the painting of Christ among the Doctors. The theme derives from the Gospel of St Luke (Luke 2, 41-52).On the bookmark at the bottom left of the panel, Dürer has recorded that this picture was `the work of five days', a pointed reference to his inscription on The Altarpiece of the Rose Garlands, the work of five months. Christ among the Doctors is not only a smaller panel, but the brushwork is much more spontaneous and the paint is applied with broad and fluid strokes. Despite Dürer's statement about five days, he based it on a number of careful studies, including one of Christ's gesticulating fingers. Although not present on the original painting, two early copies of the panel have the word `Romae' added to the inscription on the bookmark and this suggests that Dürer visited Rome late in 1506. It may also be significant that the original painting was in Rome's Galleria Barberini until its acquisition by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza in 1935.The story recorded in the panel is of Christ's visit to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, where he debated with the learned Jewish doctors (or scribes). According to the Bible, this was the first occasion on which Christ taught. Dürer's daring composition does not use the conventional temple setting which he earlier used in the lower left panel of The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin. Instead he gives a close-up view of the faces of six doctors crowding round the young Jesus. The elderly doctors, caricatured faces which may well have been influenced by Leonardo da Vinci, argue with Christ by quoting from the Scriptures and gesticulating. Christ, a sober boy of 12, quietly gestures with his fingers to make a point. Dürer contrasts Christ's youthful hands with the gnarled fingers of the ugly old man with the white cap and a gap-toothed grin	DÜRER, Albrecht	Christ Among the Doctors	Oil on panel, 65 x 80 cm	1506	religious	German	1501-1550
40049-cabare15.jpg	Maxime Dethomas (1868-1928), painter and graphic artist, was a friend of Lautrec's and one of his favoured companions on brother-crawls.

17950-windmill.jpg	"The tonal style in Dutch landscape painting of the 1630s continued well into the 1640s, while still developing, especially in the hands of Jan van Goyen. The direction in which van Goyen took landscape reveals a considered logic; as tonal painting was a realistic attempt to capture an atmosphere, its consequence was, in the end, to paint the sky over the flat, low land. Thus, in his ""Windmill by a River"", the real subject is the moving skies.Everything is subordinated to the high sky, a sky that seems to take on the colour of the vast land stretching to a low, distant horizon: a brownish-green with tinges of blue. Only the sky contains more grey - the clouds - and is more transparent in its pictorial treatment. Dunes in the foreground, caught in a splash of sunlight, introduce the distance - suggesting a high viewpoint that gives the view naturalness. The windmill, painted in the greyish-brown colour of the sky, is a discreet spatial reference point"	GOYEN, Jan van	Windmill by a River	Oil on panel, 29,4 x 36,3 cm	1642	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650

41099-021pieta.jpg	The Man of Sorrows in the arms of God the Father with the Holy Ghost between them both is a kind of Seat of Mercy or more exactly a Trinity Piet&#224;. The type is met with frequently in French and Burgundian court painting from the end of the fourteenth century onwards. One of the best known and earliest preserved examples is the tondo by Jean Malouel in the Louvre. Both in the common Man of Sorrows type and in the Trinity Piet&#224;, angels are often supporting Christ's body on both sides or carrying instruments of the Passion. The small Cologne work is part of this tradition. The Man of Sorrows is flanked by four angels, with two of them holding the Flagellation column, the scourge, the stick with the sponge and the lance. This type clearly forms the basis of the Man of Sorrows borne by an angel by Master Francke which in turn led to the Virgin showing Man of Sorrows by Memling (Melbourne). The reverse features a Holy Face of Christ.The panel is attributed to the Master of Sankt Laurenz (St Lawrence), the pupil of the Cologne Master of St Veronica. It is also assumed that this small panel was the left wing of a diptych having, on the right, a Mater Dolorosa	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	Trinity Piet?

36867-pentapt3.jpg	This panel belonged to a now dismembered pentaptych (five-paneled altarpiece). In its original configuration, St Benedict was the left, St Silvester Gozzolini the right and the Madonna and Child the centre panels (all in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The centre panel was flanked by panels depicting St John the Baptist (Perkins Collection, Sacro Convento di San Francesco, Assisi), and St John the Evangelist (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).When intact, the altarpiece would have resembled Duccio's polyptych in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena (the so-called polyptych 47). The pairing of Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist - the forerunner of Christ and the beloved disciple - to either side of the Madonna and Child is not uncommon and may relate either to the dedication of the chapel or to the name of the patron. On the other hand, the presence of Sts Benedict (c. 480&#150;543) and Silvester Gozzolini (1177&#150;1267) virtually assures that the altarpiece was painted for a monastery of the Silvestrine order, which was founded by Silvester in 1231 and followed the rule of St Benedict	SEGNA DI BUONAVENTURE	St Silvester Gozzolini	Tempera on wood, gold ground, 125 x 53 cm	1320s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08837-isaac.jpg	Cigoli's picture depicts one of the most dramatic moments in the Old Testament (Genesis 22: 1-14), where the Lord tests Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to slit Isaac's throat an angel miraculously appears and points to a ram, tangled in a thicket, that can be sacrificed instead. Cigoli shows the moment at which the angel intervenes, pulling back Abraham's arm as he points to the ram. According to Cigoli's nephew, Giovanni Battista Cardi, the picture was painted while his uncle was working for Cardinal Pompeo Arrigoni in Frascati just outside Rome. Cigoli, a Florentine, is documented in Rome between 1606-07, a date which accords well with the style of The Sacrifice of Isaac. There are several preparatory studies for the painting, one of which is on the verso of a drawing for Massimo Massimi's Ecce Homo of 1607, making it safe to assume that Cigoli was working on both pictures at the same time.Although The Sacrifice of Isaac was painted in Rome, the composition clearly recalls the Florentine tradition of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Andrea del Sarto. Isaac's sensuous nude body, however, reflects the artist's first-hand experience of classical sculpture. Despite the inherent suspense of the narrative, the picture itself lacks dramatic tension. Abraham's massive red tunic serves as a foil for Isaac's unblemished adolescent body, shifting the emphasis to the work's more lascivious characteristics. When the picture was criticised for its sexually evocative content by a visitor to Arrigoni's villa, the cardinal made an eloquent defence of the artist and the painting. The emotions evoked, he said, were the result of Cigoli's excellence as a painter; any stimulation was the fault of the viewer	CIGOLI	The Sacrifice of Isaac	Oil on canvas, 175,5 x 132,2 cm	c. 1607	religious	Italian	1551-1600

18383-1710grec.jpg	The identity of the sitter was only established in 1988, despite the fact that the portrait must record a prominent figure. He was identified with Francisco de Pisa (c. 1537-1616), Professor of Holy Scripture at Toledo University, the author of a major history of Toledo and a prominent figure in ecclesiastical affairs in the city. The identification rests on the striking resemblance between his features and those of a documented miniature of Francisco de Pisa in a private collection, that was, at one time, ascribed to El Greco himself.The open book displayed on the table is identified by lettering on its pages as BOSIUS CANONICI, presumably an edition or commentary on the corpus of canon law. The author of the text is probably Francesco Bossi or Bosio (1500/10-1584), who specialized in law. In Rome Bossi was closely associated with Carlo Borromeo, one of the key figures of the Catholic reform	GRECO, El	A Prelate	Oil on canvas, 107 x 90 cm	1600s	portrait	Spanish	1551-1600

34151-colonel.jpg	Reynolds was the first president of the Royal Academy and the author of 15 discourses on painting, which are classics of the theory of art. In this dismounted equestrian portrait, Reynolds presents Colonel Coussmaker in a pose of casual but studied negligence, the line of his body repeated in the curving neck of the horse. The summer before Reynolds painted the portrait, he traveled to Holland and Flanders and profited by his observation of Rubens's works, especially in the creation of a free and painterly surface treatment	REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua	Colonel George K.

11679-6west.jpg	This fresco is located in the 5th bay on the west wall of the Pellegrinaio in the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala. The Pellegrinaio, situated on the ground floor of the hospital, is a fourteenth-century room which took the form of a long vaulted hall.In the four scenes on the west wall, painted by Domenico di Bartolo, we find large numbers of figures gathered in a stagelike foreground and engaged in the various good works assigned to the hospital by statute in 1305. The settings for these depictions of everyday work of the hospital may reproduce actual spaces within the complex. For all their realism, the scenes are highly idealised.In the Caring for the Sick Domenico combines specific portraiture with a sensitive treatment of the nude figure.

20406-virgin_c.jpg	This painting was discovered in 1989 and attributed to Isenbrant. It was carefully copied, albeit in a different style, from Memling's Berlin Virgin Enthroned. The figure has been copied from Memling's work by means of a punch-cardboard and the colours also correspond, which shows that the work was then still accessible in Bruges. Isenbrant carried out some adaptations in Renaissance style, turning the original open portico into a semi-circular niche with medallions, baluster columns and a solid stone throne. Moreover, the book of hours has been given sixteenth-century floral borders in the Ghent-Bruges style and the flat top of the panel changed into an ogive shape.It is a remarkable example of the way in which Memling's compositions served as models until the sixteenth century	ISENBRANT, Adriaen	Virgin and Child Enthroned	Oil on oak panel, 77,5 x 56,5 cm	1510s	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

14347-descent.jpg	Ambrosius Francken was a member of the second generation of the family of painters in Antwerp. He was a Mannerist, and like other painters in the Low Countries in the last third of the 16th century, he became eclectic, a trend which itinerant Netherlandish artists of international culture helped to establish. His art was somewhat artificial, and his agitated style never achieved true pathos.This panel was painted 25 years before Rubens' Descent from the Cross, also in the Antwerp Cathedral. A simple comparison of the two works speaks about the artistic development that took place that short space of time, due not least to Rubens' own special genius	FRANCKEN, Ambrosius I	Descent from the Cross	Oil on panel, 122 x 95 cm	1580s	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
14937-6pould07.jpg	Things sacred are present in the background of Gauguin's portraits, which he wanted to put in expressive harmony with the faces, according to the Symbolist doctrine which inspired also Van Gogh.

43921-penn.jpg	The genre in which English painters were least happy in the second half of the 18th century was history painting; the efforts of Reynolds in this direction are strangely petrified for so living a painter. Yet it was through history painting that Neo-Classicism invaded the art in England. A Scot, Gavin Hamilton (1738-1820) and an American, Benjamin West, who enjoyed a prodigious success, were in advance of the French painter Jacques-Louis David in the conception of a painting as a scene from Classical history, based upon thorough archeological research.West was most successful when least pretentious; his illustrations of English historical events are simply illustrations, simply composed, uneffectedly direct. Neo-classicism had trained West to give value to the facts of the scene depicted, removing anything merely decorative or liable to spoil the sense of witnessing an actual event	WEST, Benjamin	The Treaty of Penn with the Indians	Oil on canvas, 190 x 274 cm	1771-72	historical	American	1751-1800

06651-birdtrax.jpg	The composition of The Bird Trap is one of the most popular created by the Brueghel family. The prototype has generally been thought to be the painting by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Pieter Brueghel the Younger and his busy studio produced numerous (over forty) copies and variations of the composition. The earliest known dated version by Brueghel the Younger is the painting dated 1601, the latest is dated 1626. In this version, several figures were added to the composition c. 1630-35, by an artist in the circle of Hendrick Avercamp	BRUEGHEL, Pieter the Younger	The Bird Trap	Oil on panel, 46 x 68 cm	-	landscape	Flemish	1551-1600

They were intended for private devotion.This painting, executed on an arched panel, is an extraordinarily refined Imago Pietatis: the dead Christ appears to rise from a sarcophagus attended by the Virgin and St John the Evangelist. Christ's body is wrapped in a shroud that leaves his torso exposed; his mother holds his head with her left arm, as the Evangelist supports Christ at the waist.

15510-6resurr.jpg	"The official prestige value of the upper picture on the main chapel wall (the Confirmation of the Rule) is clear. In contrast, the fresco beneath it, directly above the altarpiece, is devoted to the Sassetti family's private history. In 1478, the year of the Pazzi plot, their son Teodoro died; but a few months later Nera Corsi Sassetti gave birth to a second son. As they felt him to be a gift from God, they made yet another change in the plans for the altar wall in their mortuary chapel. Ghirlandaio had to abandon his design for a scene showing the appearance of Saint Francis in Arles, for which preliminary drawings still exist, and paint the Resurrection of the Boy. This was how the Sassetti intended to express their gratitude for their new-bon son Teodoro II.The events in the Resurrection of the Boy are taking place just outside the church of Santissima Trinita at the Ponte Santissima Trinita. ""... In it he represented the Ponte Santissima Trinita (the old one, by Taddeo Gaddi; the present one was built by Ammannati almost a hundred years later) with the palace of the Spini, the first scene showing the appearance of St Francis in the air to raise a child of that family... and other figures who are marvelling and rejoicing at the miracle, affording no little pleasure to the rest of us. Among them are portraits of Agnolo Acciaioli, Palla Strozzi..."" (Vasari).While playing, a boy falls out of the windows of the Palazzo Spini. A red ball falling to the street below him. Some passers-by see the falling child, rush up in help, but it is too late: the child is dead. The boy who met with the fatal accident is already lying on a bier surrounded by mourners. Then, however, two Franciscans succeed in interceding with Saint Francis on their behalf, and the child is brought back to life. The artist moved this miracle from Rome where it actually took place, to Florence - just outside the church in which the picture is painted  in order to be able to incorporate many of the portraits requested by the donor in the groups of onlookers"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Resurrection of the Boy	Fresco	1483-85	religious	Italian	1451-1500

The landscape is full of streams of people fleeing with their cattle.The painting makes it clear that mankind is dominated by fate, a force between heaven and earth. The demonic element, that has power over the earth, is depicted like a dream. Goya is basically using a Baroque device, allegory. He just makes the painting difficult to interpret, for we do not know whether the figure is intended to be a personification of revolution itself, of mankind exploding in rage, or its opposite, danger taking on visionary form	GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de	The Colossus	Oil on canvas, 120 x 100 cm	1808	mythological	Spanish	1801-1850

29948-port_fam.jpg	The grotesque peasants carousing, brawling, or engaged in swinish gluttony in disorderly hovels are characteristic of Ostade's boisterous work of his early phase. In the 1640s his interiors gain in spaciousness and atmosphere. By the middle of the century Ostade had changed to a more idyllic style. His figures became calmer and more respectable. There is a new emphasis on local colour and an orderly arrangement. The reason for the shift in Ostade's mood has not been established. Perhaps it is related to a change in his clientele, to his own conception of himself, and his ideas about his task as an artist	OSTADE, Adriaen Jansz. van	Portrait of a Family	Oil on wood, 70 x 88 cm	1654	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700

41290-06martin.jpg	The panel, painted on both sides, was part of the moving wing of a winged altarpiece. The panel represents the best-known episode from the legend of St. Martin. The young knight at the town-gate of Amiens cuts his cloak in two and gives half of it to a beggar. In the interior represented on the left side of the picture another episode from the legend can be seen. Christ appears at night to Martin, who suddenly realizes that it was the Saviour himself who put him to the test in the guise of a beggar. He is then baptized.The building on the left, decorated with statues mounted on brackets, and the room into which we can look, show the distant influence of Netherlandish art. This building, a fantastic edifice of many storeys, is an imaginative feat on the part of the painter. Although it seems the painter had some difficulty in representing the figure on horseback, his skill is amply demonstrated in the symmetrical composition, the distressed expression of the faces, the careful treatment of such details as the hair and the beard, and also the freshness of the colours	UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian	Saint Martin and the Beggar	Tempera on wood, 88 x 91 cm	c. 1490	religious	Hungarian	1451-1500

Frederick Henry was married in 1625 to Amalia van Solms-Braunfels, and left one son, William II of Orange, and four daughters.

11363-1delaroc.jpg	Delaroche's early work consists mainly of subjects from the Old Testament, while later he chose subjects from French and English history. He was one of the most popular painters of his time, his paintings satisfied the need for education through art and the demand for sensibility. Both his carefully researched interiors and costumes and the theatrical content made his paintings so popular. In The Death of Elizabeth I, Queen of England the cultivation of material actually distracts attention from the real subject. But this was in keeping with contemporary taste for decorative history painting, which had gone to extremes in its meticulous attention to detail in the objects, furniture, and costumes.The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1827/28	DELAROCHE, Paul	The Death of Elizabeth I, Queen of England	Oil on canvas, 422 x 343 cm	1828	historical	French	1801-1850

This detail and also the triptych on the altar which recalls the one painted by Bastiani in his canvas depicting the ""Donation of the Relic"", suggests that Gentile Bellini wished here to set the scene in the interior of the church of St John the Evangelist.

06590-5sense1.jpg	This piece, a characteristic product of the Rubens workshop, is one of the paintings in the series depicting the five senses. The allegorical content of these works was always obvious, and the pieces of the series did not become separated. The still-life details enumerating many traditional symbols were painted by Jan Brueghel.The amazing increase in the commercial and agricultural product range caused a complete restructuring of people's perception - a change which can be seen very clearly in the numerous paintings and series of paintings on the subject of the Five Senses. Jan Brueghel the Elder's famous variations on this motif - now in the Prado, Madrid - show a number of settings, each of which is associated with the five senses. The dramatic 'unity of character' has been divided into components of the senses, thus reflecting an increasing compartmentalization of the world into functional spheres - a world which is defined in terms of luxury goods.In Jan Brueghel's paintings, the part of purely passive reception or physical consumption is played by an allegorical female figure. Interestingly, by depicting her naked or semi-naked breasts and sometimes her entire body, the painter emphasizes an element of eroticism. In this way the consumption of luxury goods and an emotional state of ecstasy are recognized as a syndrome.In the still-life of Hearing we can examine nearly all the instruments of the period. Near the Flemish harpsichord we can see a drum, a trumpet, a trombone, a cornetto, a lysard, several flutes, various sizes of violas and gambas, a lute, and a shawm. On a table to the right are a small horn, a trumpet, a bell and a reed pipe. The title of the musical score reveals that it is a six-part madrigal dedicated to Prince Pietro Philippi Albert and to Princess Isabella. The rifle, leaned against the chair, is rendered as a sound-producing implement, along with the other musical instruments used during a hunt; it does not unequivocally refer to Mars, as it has been proposed. In this painting the clock is not the symbol of transitoriness, rather it is a musical clock, several versions of which are visible in the right background. The talking and singing birds were also included on account of their voices. In the hall opening from the left rear, members of a musical group are entertaining themselves. The pictures on the wall of the room also refer to music: they depict the concert of the gods and Orpheus taming the wild animals with his music. The triptych showing the Annunciation and the announcement to the shepherds depicted on the inside cover of the harpsichord are also episodes which can be associated with sound.The nude female figure is, according to some opinions, Euterpe, the Muse of music, while others see her as Venus. The goddess of love may indeed be looked for in a painting associated with the human senses. Such supposition is supported by the presence of a little cherub (Amor?) in four of the five pictures, although he is only depicted as a winged Amor in the allegories of Touch and Sight.As an animal famous for its keen hearing, the stag became the symbol for this sense. In his Iconologia, Ripa prescribes the inclusion of a stag at the side of a woman playing the lute	BRUEGHEL, Jan the Elder	The Sense of Hearing	Oil on panel, 65 x 107 cm	1618	mythological	Flemish	1551-1600
30412-steccata.jpg	In the 1530s Parmigianino frescoed the under-arch above the altar in Santa Maria della Steccata. He graced his painted coffer articulation with sculptural rosettes. A colourful variety of fruit garlands, animals, and grotesques, in red and gold, produces a magnificent effect. At the spring line of the arch, Parmigianino painted two sets of three beautiful, graceful women in various side views, suggesting the Three Graces. Their elegance is analogous to the perfected sweeping forms of the precious vessels they bear on their heads. Grisaille figures of Adam and Eve and Moses and Aaron frame the group of women	PARMIGIANINO	Decoration of the under-arch above the main altar	Fresco	1530s	other	Italian	1501-1550
10944-doria2.jpg	The left wing of the diptych depicts the Virgin and Child in the Church, while the right wing the donor Antonio Siciliano and St Anthony.The diptych was commissioned by Antonio Siciliano who served as chamberlain and secretary to Massimiliano Sforza, the Duke of Milan. In 1513 he was dispatched to Margaret of Austria in Mechelen on a diplomatic mission. It is assumed that Siciliano commissioned the painting from Gossart, who about 1513 worked at Margaret's court in Mechelen. However, the authorship of the diptych is debated, especially that of the donor (right) wing. Several alternative suggestions were proposed, the authorship being connected to the Antwerp Mannerists or to the artists contributing to the Grimani Breviary. Presently the right wing is attributed to Jan Gossart.The left panel is attributed to Gerard David. This attribution is supported by recent technical examination. More than any other Bruges painter, David inherited Jan van Eyck's legacy. The left panel of the diptych is an adaptation of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. David made adjustments to the earlier model: he centred the Virgin in a wider view of the nave, added a third arch to the choir screen, and closed off the composition at the right with a series of columns matching those of the bays opposite	DAVID, Gerard	The Doria-Pamphili Diptych (left wing)	Oil on oak panel, 40 x 22 cm	1510-15	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
22256-c_couple.jpg	"Judith Leyster is one of the very few women to have been accepted as a member of the Haarlem Guild of Painters. Although a contemporary historian described her as a leading light in art (punning on her name Leyster, which means ""lodestar"") she remained unknown for a long time and her works were either believed lost, or were attributed to Frans Hals. She probably worked in his studio around 1630 and was also a friend of his family, for one year later she became godmother to Hals' daughter Maria.Like Hals at the same time, the young Leyster adopted the style of the Utrecht Caravaggisti, with their strong chiaroscuro modelling in the manner of Caravaggio. From the mid-1620, she concentrated more on vividly illuminated genre scenes, generally featuring half figures of merry musicians, gamblers and whores, strongly influenced by the painting of Terbrugghen and Honthorst.While the Utrecht school of painters still rounded the surfaces of their objects smoothly between light and shade, Hals and his school adopted a broad, vibrant and independent brushstroke. Leyster's work can be distinguished from that of Hals through her generally more discordant handling of colour, her sketchier treatment of hands, the wryly distorted smiles of her figures and her altogether flightier brushwork"	LEYSTER, Judith	Carousing Couple	Oil on canvas, 68 x 54 cm	1630	genre	Dutch	1601-1650

03570-04reale.jpg	Beaumont's contribution to the painting of the Palazzo Reale includes, in addition to four living rooms, two galleries, of which the Galleria della Regina, later named after him, is one of the largest (60 m long) and the most magnificent of its kind. In 1833, it was separated from the palace complex, and has since served as the Armeria Reale, housing the Savoyard weapon collection.The subject of the ceiling painting in the Galleria is the legend of Aeneas, the mortal son of Venus who escaped from the burning Troy with his father and his son, and after many trials and misadventures landed at last at the mouth of the Tiber. There he became through his son Ascanius the progenitor of the gens Julia.The picture shows one of the two tondi with Aeneas Landing on the Mouth of the Tiber	BEAUMONT, Claudio Francesco	Aeneas Legend: Aeneas Landing on the Mouth of the Tiber	Fresco	1731-33	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

09970-decadenc.jpg	The peak in theatrical Romanticism came in the Salon of 1847, Couture, a pupil of Gros, exhibited this painting nearly eight meters long. It had been commissioned by the government for the Palais du Luxembourg. One can see the work as the sum of all that French painting had striven for between the Neoclassical period and Romanticism. Not only does the work cite painterly and compositional devices from old masters like Veronese, Tiepolo, Rubens and Poussin, but to Couture's contemporaries the artist also seemed to have succeeded in combining Antiquity and the present. It is all to be found united here:  the antique columned hall, sculpture competing with living figures, beautiful forms created with line  in the manner of Ingres, and Delaroche's delight in detail.A woman is the central figure, placed so that she will draw all eyes. She is stretched out in the middle of a large crowd of people who are abandoning themselves to all the vices that are supposed to have led to the downfall of Roma. The scene is framed by five larger-than-life-size sculptures representing men from Roman history, their gestures seeming to demand a return to virtue	COUTURE, Thomas	Romans of the Decadence	Oil on canvas, 466 x 773 cm	1847	historical	French	1801-1850

40893-04virgin.jpg	The anonymous artist who executed this panel is referred to as the Master of the Embroidered Foliage. This name  is based on his characteristic foregrounds, carpeted with flowers and decorative leaves. He appears to have been active in Brussels and the South Netherlands, and was clearly influenced by such Flemish masters as Rogier van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes.This painting is one of several autograph variant versions. A version having a similar throne is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh.

The event depicted here took place during the latter stages of the Twelve Years Truce with the Spanish, when the nascent Dutch Republic was riven with internal political and religious strife.The concept and most of the execution of this painting are entirely that of Saenredam, the staffage figures and horses are by Pieter Post	SAENREDAM, Pieter Jansz	The Town Hall at Haarlem with the Entry of Prince Maurits to Replace the Governers in 1618	Oil on oak panel, 40 x 50 cm	c. 1631	historical	Dutch	1601-1650
16952-4portina.jpg	Soberly painted in monochrome, the panels are entirely occupied by the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin of the Annunciation.

14512-lazar.jpg	This is the only other authentic work of Froment beside The Burning Bush. The central panel depicts The Raising of Lazarus, the other scenes on the side panels are Magdalen Anoints the Feet of Christ (right wing), Martha at the Feet of Christ (left wing), The Donors (outer face of right wing), The Madonna and Child (outer face of left wing).The tradition that the triptych was painted for Cosimo il Vecchio is rendered improbable by the fact that the donor is in clerical dress. The painting of the exterior faces, which bears the signature, is of a quality superior to that of the interior ones. It is assumed that the man looking out of the picture at the upper left corner of the central panel is a self-portrait	FROMENT, Nicolas	Triptych	Oil on wood, 175 x 134 cm (central), 175 x 66 cm (each side wing)	1461	religious	French	1451-1500

39841-0chieri1.jpg	The Villa Chiericati was built in the first half of the sixteenth century for Ludovico Chiericati, a nobleman from Vicenza. It underwent numerous restorations and reworkings over time, resulting in its current architectural form, an extended structure with a simple façade that is barely enlivened by a tympanum supported by four Ionic pilasters. A room on the north side, called Room of Landscapes, was decorated with six frescoes of landscape scenes, each incorporating two zodiac signs, by Lodewijk Toeput. During one of the updatings the frescoes were painted over, and it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century, on the occasion of yet another restoration, that they were finally revealed.The landscapes contain explicit references to the sequence of the seasons and their related zodiac signs, the marking of time that rhythmically measures the work and the days of good guardianship of the land. These are extremely naturalistic paintings, at times enlivened by the presence of slender little figures rendered with a touch of vitality.On the wall shown in the present picture, the vivid figure of the page and his greyhound stand out flanked by a Landscape between Autumn and Winter and a Winter Landscape	TOEPUT, Lodewijk	View of a wall	Fresco	1580-85	other	Flemish	1551-1600

30993-christ_c.jpg	This canvas counts among the artists's  earliest works, realized before he had completely mastered the technique of preparing the support with red ocher and oil. Too much of the latter undermined the adhesiveness of the paint surface, which has flaked off and exposed the ocher ground, now turned a brownish colour. Based on a composition by Rubens, the work evinces stunning virtuosity in the handling of the three nude bodies, their torsioned attitudes the fruit of long and close anatomical study	PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista	Christ Crucified between the Two Thieves	Oil on canvas, 76 x 64 cm	c. 1710	religious	Italian	1701-1750
44024-0braque.jpg	"The armorial bearings on the back indicate that this portable triptych was the property of Jehan Braque and his wife Catherine de Brabant, of Tournai, who were married in about 1450-51. Jehan Braque died soon afterwards, in 1452; his young widow, who did not marry again till 1461, must have commissioned this triptych in his memory.The Braque Triptych ranks among Rogier van der Weyden's most celebrated works. It is a small-scale work of the kind that were set upon portable altars in the oratories of wealthy individuals. When closed, it shows the classical vanity theme, a skull and a cross. Open, it displays images of Christ in the centre, and to either side - the Virgin, St John the Evangelist, St John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. They are represented against a landscape that is rendered down to the finest detail, with its rivers and mountains, grass and leaves so precisely drawn they could almost be counted and tiny figures visible in the distance in the streets of imaginary towns - a favourite motif of the Flemish masters.Pictures showing busts of Christ and the Virgin had existed earlier north of the Alps, but a sequence of several saints shown half length seems to derive from a type of altarpiece found in Italy from the 13th century onward. The innovation is to place them in front of a wide, coherent landscape relating to the figures themselves not realistically, but in context. It stands for the entire world ruled by Christ and to which He descended incarnate as man, as described at the beginning of the Gospel of St John: ""And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."" If the dark exterior was a reminder of the inevitability of death, the wide, radiant interior with its saintly figures allowed the devout viewer to hope for salvation.Artistically, the triptych is very close to the Beaune Altarpiece. The head of the Virgin Mary, and in particular the head of Christ, are so like their counterparts in the picture of the Last Judgment that they must have been executed from the same cartoon (full-size design for a painting). It is not certain whether the work is entirely by Rogier's hand; the underdrawing reveals thin lines not at all typical of him, and perhaps done with a pen instead of Rogier's usual brush. There are also some differences in the artistic execution: the Virgin's face, for instance, looks waxen, and inflexible around the eyes by comparison with the wonderful, tenderly painted, and lifelike Mary Magdalene, which is among Rogier's finest works"	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Braque Family Triptych	Oil on oak panel, 41 x 68 cm (central panel), 41 x 34 cm (wings each)	c. 1450	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

42289-0707vela.jpg	One of the tasks required of Velázquez, the court painter, was the painting of altarpieces, though to a lesser extent than painting portraits. The Coronation of the Virgin was painted around 1645, possibly for the queen's oratory in the Alcazar in Madrid. Angelic putti carry the virginal Madonna up to heaven on clouds; Christ and God the Father hold a wreath of roses over her head, and the dove of the Holy Ghost hovers above her in an aureole of light. The glory of the coronation of the Mother of God and her perfect features are signs of her virginity. The virginal face of the Madonna reflects the emotions aroused in Spain between 1613 and 1620 by the postulated Immaculate Conception of the Virgin. In this context Pacheco encouraged painters to create emphatically youthful depictions of Mary	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	The Coronation of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 178 x 135 cm	1645	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

42968-1maggior1.jpg	This painting was commissioned by the Venetian government for the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio of the Palazzo Ducale. It is one of the thirty five panels on the ceiling.Rising above the bank of clouds, the royally garbed personification of Venice sits enthroned between the twin towers of the city's Arsenal, about to be crowned with laurel by flying victories. Arrayed at her feet and offering her wise counsel are personifications of peace, abundance, fame, happiness, honour, security, and freedom. An especially splendid triumphal arch, fronted by twisting columns, marks the top of an enormous balcony which seems to burst through the ceiling into the ether beyond in order to accommodate the multitudes of celebrating people stipulated in the commission. At the base, Venice's smiling subjects seem undisturbed by the enormous size and energy of careening horsemen in their midst reminder of Venice's considerable military might. Illusionistic foreshortenings and dramatic light effects serve to give political allegory a previously unimagined dynamism and visual excitement	VERONESE, Paolo	Apotheosis of Venice	Oil on canvas, 904 x 579 cm	1585	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
00581-05pazzi.jpg	The Madonna and Child with Saints, that Andrea frescoed in the chapel in the castle of Trebbio (Val di Sieci), belonging to the Pazzi family, is influenced by Domenico Veneziano's peaceful and luminous painting. Despite the strong naturalism of the two saints on either side of the Madonna, the scene is characterized by a gentleness of forms, a delicacy of colour harmonies, and a majestic composition that Andrea had most probably borrowed from Veneziano's Carnesecchi Tabernacle and his frescoes in Sant'Egidio	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Madonna and Child with Saints	Fresco, 290 x 212 cm	c. 1445	religious	Italian	1401-1450
12989-pepijn.jpg	Rubens, Van Dyck and Jordaens, often named in the same breath, are the most prominent artists of the Flemish Baroque. The trio dominated artistic life in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. All three made an enormous contribution to the fame of the city of Antwerp, but it is Rubens who bears the greatest authority, because he was the most versatile and talented.The youngest of the three great masters was Anthony van Dyck. He worked with Rubens for a time in his youth, after which he spent most of his career in England and Italy. He was even more admired in England than in his own country, and he had a significant influence upon English painting. Van Dyck's oeuvre, less varied than that of Rubens, consists mainly of brilliant portraits. His sensitive personality and restless temperament were brought to bear in penetrating psychological studies of members of leading families, the nobility and royalty. His sober Portrait of Marten Pepijn shows the artist as an energetic man of fifty-eight years, depicted in a black jerkin with a refined pleated collar.

10824-stvaast2.jpg	"Robert Campin, who is generally identified as the Master of Flémalle, had a workshop in Tournai from 1406 at the latest, and, as we know from several documents, it received many commissions from the city, various institutions, and private individuals. According to a document (which is a copy of old records of the painters' guild, dating from around 1482, that is to say some 50 years later) a certain Jacques Daret was an ""apprentice"" in the workshop at about the same time as Rogier van der Weyden; he joined it on 12 April 1427 and became a master on 18 October 1432. We do know, however, that Daret had already been working with Campin for over ten years, so he must have learned his trade as a painter long before 1427; the description ""apprenticeship"" cannot therefore be correct for him at this period. We may assume that both Daret and Van der Weyden completed their real apprenticeship earlier and they must have worked together in Campin's workshop around 1430 as trained painters.Four paintings executed by Campin's pupil Jacques Daret in 1434-35 for Jean du Clercq, abbot of St. Vaast in Arras, are extant and are unusually well documented. They originally ornamented the wings of an altar shrine decorated with alabaster sculptures. In these panels Daret shows himself a capable if not particularly innovative or sensitive artist, very closely related to Rogier and in particular to the Master of Flémalle. Daret's Visitation of Mary is so similar to Rogier's painting of the same subject (Museum der Bildende Künste, Leipzig)), which is certainly later, that we have to assume they had a common model. And Daret follows one picture from the ""Flémalle group"" so closely, the Nativity now in Dijon Museum, that it can almost be called a free copy.This kind of painting, which now appears mediocre in comparison with the works of masters such as Rogier van der Weyden, was still so new and unusual in its time that a chronicler tells us how the donor, Jean de Clercq, seen here kneeling on the left with his abbot's insignia, proudly showed this altarpiece wing to the participants in the peace conference negotiating the Treaty of Arras in 1435"	DARET, Jacques	Visitation	Oil on oak panel, 57 x 52 cm	1434-35	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
03554-agony_g.jpg	Though most of his activity took place in Mantua, Giuseppe Bazzani is usually ranged with the Settecento painters of Venice, owing to his stylistic relationship to them. His fluid brush-work, soft forms and fiery colours certainly show the influence of Venetian masters, but his dramatic expression and lively composition show greater individualism	BAZZANI, Giuseppe	The Agony of Christ in the Garden	Oil on canvas, 42 x 36 cm	-	religious	Italian	1701-1750
03600-4view.jpg	Frescoes in the oratories of brotherhoods are found throughout Italy. In 1516 to 1518 the Sienese brotherhood of Mary and Bernardino commissioned Girolamo del Pacchia, Sodoma, and Domenico Beccafumi to fresco the walls of their oratory with a cycle on the life of Mary, The artists painted two stories each: Pacchia, the Birth of Mary and the Annunciation; Sodoma, the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation of Mary; and Beccafumi, the Betrothal of Mary and the Death of the Virgin. The missing scenes on the right-hand longitudinal wall, the Visitation and the Assumption of the Virgin were not painted by Sodoma until the late 1520s, and Baccafumi's altarpiece still later, between 1535 and 1537. The cycle begins on the left wall (The Birth of Mary to THe Betrothal of Mary), and continues above the altar wall (Annunciation) and the right longitudinal wall (Visitation to Assumption of the Virgin) through the second of the short walls (The Coronation of Mary). In addition to the stories from the life of Mary, there are four frescoed standing figures of Franciscan saints in the corners of the longitudinal walls	BECCAFUMI, Domenico	View of the Oratory	Fresco	1520s	religious	Italian	1501-1550

44258-oude2.jpg	About 1650 the most interesting developments in architectural painting took place in Delft, where a new phase began with the church interiors by Gerard Houckgeest, Emanuel de Witte, and Hendrick Cornelisz van Vliet. Stylistic affinities with works done during the decade in the city by Carel Fabritius, Pieter de Hooch, an Vermeer are apparent, and Vermeer's own exceptional masterpieces in this branch of painting can be viewed as part of the new movement.In Saenredam's earlier church interiors the line of vision is always at an angle of about 90&#176; to the centre of the nave or to the wall of the building he depicts. Houckgeest had the new idea  of shifting his position to the side to give an angle of about 45&#176; to the principal axis of the church. The new position creates intriguingly intricate diagonal views across the church. Emanuel de Witte experimented with similar perspectival schemes about 1650. His earliest dated interior that employs the new point of view is the Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon. It does not focus on a tomb of a hero, but on the minister preaching from a pulpit, which is still in place, to a large congregation. In de Witte's painting the Word, not patriotism, is stressed	WITTE, Emanuel de	Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon	Oil on wood, 61 x 44 cm	1651	interior	Dutch	1651-1700

42233-0302vela.jpg	"In this painting the restriction of surrounding areas and the general pose found in earlier portraits of the king are still present, but the subject's whole attitude is more relaxed, the flesh tints, probably under the influence of Rubens, are painted with more fluidity, the accents of colour - eyes gleaming like black tortoiseshell, the golden lights on the waves of the hair - are placed with more emphasis, and shapes conveying Baroque dignity, such as the profuse folds of the red curtain, have made their way into the formerly sparse interior. Above all, Velázquez's new delight in luxuriant colour is reflected in his depiction of the silk embroidery and the silver and brown tones of the king's clothing.The king is holding in his right hand a paper with the inscription ""Senor/Diego Velázquez/ Pintor de V. Mg"" - the opening words of a petition to him from Velázquez.The unattractive matt white of the stockings is the result of an unskilful restoration of the picture in 1936, but otherwise the work is a good example of the skilled manner that Velázquez had now mastered"	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Philip IV in Brown and Silver	Oil on canvas, 200 x 113 cm	1631-32	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650
36770-lochorst.jpg	The triptych was ordered in 1526 by Herman Lochorst, canon of the cathedral in Utrecht. The central panel depicts the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem. The interior wings present saints venerated in Utrecht: Agnes, Pope Cornelius, and Anthony on the left, Sebastian, Gertrude of Nivelles, and Christopher on the right. Of these figures, St Agnes is the most striking in her charming classical pose and the sheer, gauzelike chiton she wears. On the outsides of the wings (not shown here) the donor and his family are presented, kneeling in front of their patron saints	SCOREL, Jan van	Lochorst Triptych	Oil on wood	1526-27	religious	Dutch	1501-1550
27055-anatomy.jpg	This painting is one of the earliest of its kind in Dutch art. In composition these works could be considered the unsavoury counter-parts of civic-guard company portraits, which often depicts the officers around a table laden with food.The painting was commissioned by the surgeon's guild in Delft from the leading painter of the city, Michiel van Miereveld. It is specified in the Latin inscription on the railing that the painter's elder son, Pieter, actually carried out the painting following his father's design. No independent pictures by Pieter is known, and he died six years after working on the painting, at the age of twenty-seven	MIEREVELD, Michiel Jansz. van	Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Willem van der Meer	Oil on canvas, 144 x 198 cm	1617	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
41990-davidgol.jpg	This canvas closely follows Caravaggio's naturalistic approach, both in terms of form and content. A strong chiaroscuro governs the scene, highlighting the figure of David. The artist has created a compact group of half-length figures situated behind a table on which David has rested the decapitated head of Goliath, all set against a dark background which could be a wall and which serves to block any recession into depth, creating a very shallow foreground space	VALENTIN DE BOULOGNE	David with the Head of Goliath and Two Soldiers	Oil on canvas, 99 x 134 cm	1620-22	religious	French	1601-1650
06277-capture.jpg	The Royal Family Privateers owed their unusual name to the fact that each vessel was named after a member of the Royal Family. They carried out a series of dashing exploits in the 1740's, commanded by James Talbot, and several of these were painted by Brooking. This painting probably depicts the action on 10th July 1745 when the Prince Frederick and the Duke, under the command of Commodore James Talbot, captured two French vessels, the Marquese d'Antin and the Louis Erasme. The action was particularly celebrated since the French ships were found to have over one million pounds in bullion aboard. When the ships reached Bristol, the treasure was taken to London in 45 wagons, accompanied by an armed guard and preceded by a band	BROOKING, Charles	The Capture of a French Ship by Royal Family Privateers	Oil on canvas, 58 x 84 cm	-	historical	English	1701-1750
42428-cavalier.jpg	This painting probably had a companion piece representing a Lady at Her Toilet.

12966-charles2.jpg	This likeness of the king on horseback takes as its point of departure the archetypal image on the obverse of all the Great Seals of England: the sovereign as warrior. King Charles is wearing Greenwich-made armour and holding a commander's baton. A page carries his helmet. In keeping with the imperial claim of the inscription (in Latin on the tablet tied to the tree in this portrait: CAROLUS REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE - Charles King of Great Britain), the pose and woodland setting echo Titian's equestrian portrait of the Emperor Charles V at Muhlberg. (Titian's painting itself recalled the famous Roman bronze of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius on horseback.) Over his armour Charles wears a gold locket bearing the image of Saint George and the Dragon, the so-called Lesser George. He wore it constantly; it contained a portrait of his wife, and was with him the day he died. Here, however, it identifies him with the Order of the Garter of which Saint George was patron. As Garter Sovereign he is riding, like Charles V, at the head of his chivalrous knights in defence of the faith. In a profound sense the portrait is a visual assertion of Charles's claim to Divine Kingship. Albeit high above our heads - the horizon line ensures that our viewpoint is roughly at the level of his stirrup - his face is undistorted by foreshortening. Van Dyck's three-quarter view refines his features, and he bestrides his horse with a remote air of noble contemplation	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Charles I on Horseback	Oil on canvas, 365 x 289 cm	c. 1635	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

24073-3sposi04.jpg	One the most remarkable portions of the decoration of the Camera degli Sposi is the fictive oculus, or opening to the sky, located on the room's low ceiling. Created with sharp foreshortenings, the oculus is ringed with figures looking down on the room below; a potted plant is precariously perched on its wooden support, seemingly ready to fall at any moment. It is a brilliant tour de force that invariably engages the spectator, who must join in the game by standing directly beneath the circular trellis.The magnificent details of the ceiling and some of the busts and scenes stand among the most convincing trompe l'oeil passages of the entire Italian Renaissance	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Ceiling Oculus	Fresco, diameter: 270 cm	1465-74	religious	Italian	1451-1500
24370-franklin.jpg	This portrait of Benjamin Franklin was commissioned by Robert Alexander, of the firm of William Alexander &#38; Sons, Edinburgh. The beribboned document held by Franklin in the portrait is not a treaty or an Act of Parliament, but one of Alexander's deeds. The other books and pamphlets suggest the learned evidence brought in support of a wise man's decision.

07248-canal617.jpg	In this work and its companion picture (Capriccio: A Palladian Design for the Rialto Bridge, also in Parma) Canaletto created two of his most complex and intriguing capricci. He had already depicted an unrealised scheme for the Rialto Bridge, but in these works went one stage further and painted alternatives to the actual bridge surrounded by a sophisticated and extensive group of invented buildings.The bridge and extraordinary circular temple at the left appear to be almost entirely imaginary. Such spectacular flights of fancy may at root be based on reminiscences of details in works by Claude Lorraine (1600-82) and Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-78), but Canaletto has transformed possible sources of this type into a decorative creation all of his own.

37331-6orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342. Orsini's coat-of-arms appears in the background of the Road to Calvary. The polyptych was probably transferred to the charterhouse of Champmol, near Dijon, in the late 14th century"	SIMONE MARTINI	Entombment	Tempera on wood, 22 x 15 cm	1335-44	religious	Italian	1301-1350

39711-1ferra2.jpg	"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.Titian's sources for the Bacchus and Ariadne were a variety of classical texts (especially Catullus and Ovid), all of them concerning Ariadne, the daughter of the king of Crete. Because of her love for Theseus, she helped him escape her father's labyrinth by means of a ball of thread. However, Theseus deserted her on Naxos while they were returning to Athens. There, she became the lover of the god Bacchus. Above her, already visible, is a crown of stars representing the ""Corona Borealis"", into which she (or, according to a different tradition, her bridal head-dress) is eventually transformed.This painting is among Titian's most Raphaelesque, particularly in the contrapposto of Ariadne and the controlled energy of Bacchus and his train, who seem more numerous than they really are. To achieve colouristic brilliance, Titian has used the strongest pigments then available on the market"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Bacchus and Ariadne	Oil on canvas, 175 x 190 cm	1520-22	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

38746-venus_ad.jpg	Through Cassiano dal Pozzo, secretary of Cardinal Francesco Barberini and the patron of Nicolas Poussin, Testa gained access in Rome to the circle around Poussin.

18797-landscap.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve pieces in the Budapest museum. The small pictures representing islands in the environs of Venice were formerly attributed to Francesco Guardi. Though the style and treatment of these pictures are fresh and airy, their quality falls far behind the standard of Francesco Guardi's works. The drawings and pictures of his son and imitator, Giacomo, are closest to the Budapest series which experts lately ranged unanimously among the oeuvre of the younger master	GUARDI, Giacomo	Landscape in the Environs of Venice	Oil on canvas, 17 x 23 cm	-	landscape	Italian	1751-1800
17722-209goya.jpg	La Caída and La Cucana belong to a series of seven paintings of 'country subjects' made to decorate the large gallery in the Duchess of Osuna's apartment in the Alameda Palace, the Osuna country residence outside Madrid known as El Capricho. The paintings were delivered on 22 April 1787. La Caída is described in Goya's account for the paintings submitted on 12 May 1787: 'an excursion in hilly country, with a woman in a faint after a fall from an ass; she is assisted by an abbot and another man who support her in their arms; two other women mounted on asses [and] expressing emotion and another figure of a servant form the main group and others who had fallen behind are seen in the distance, and a landscape to correspond.'Though on a smaller scale, this series of decorative paintings is similar in style and character to the tapestry cartoons; but unlike the tapestry cartoons it includes some scenes, such as La Caída, which appear to represent actual occurrences. It has been suggested that the fainting woman in La Caída is the Duchess of Osuna, that the figure supporting her is Goya and that the mounted woman weeping is the Duchess of Alba	GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de	The Fall (La Caída)	Oil on canvas, 169 x 100 cm	1786-87	genre	Spanish	1801-1850
40817-kingdrin.jpg	The subject is taken from the annual Flemish celebration of the Feast of Epiphany. The Feast of the Epiphany or Three Kings (Matthew 2:1-12) was celebrated on the 6th January, and was usually the occasion of a large family dinner. The evening began with the proclamation of a 'king', chosen by lot. This was often done by the concealment of a bean in a large cake, and the person in whose portion it was found would preside over the festivities. The subject was particularly popular among artists, notably the Flemish painter Jacob Jordaens, who painted it several times, and in most cases, as here, the role of the 'King' is appropriately played by the eldest member of the company.The painting has in the past been attributed to the Utrecht painter Jan Gerritsz. van Bronckhorst. However, stylistically the painting is closer to the work of Haarlem painters such as Jan Miense Molenaer and Judith Leyster, in whose circle such subjects seem to have enjoyed a particular vogue	UNKNOWN MASTER, Dutch	The King Drinks!

Apollo, who advances in his chariot through the ring of the Zodiac, is accompanied by the Hours and preceded by Aurora and the Zephyr.

The striking outlines of Alpsandsteingebirge can be seen on the horizon, with the fortress of Königstein standing out most noticeably.Thiele is at the peak of his abilities in this painting: the landscape swings rhythmically with the river and the chains of hills, until the contours all dissolve in the background. A feeling of distance is produced by the dark brown passages at the front. Late seventeenth-century landscapes, such as those of Pieter Gysels, perhaps, may have stimulated this view	THIELE, Johann Alexander	View of Dresden from the Loessnitz Heights	Oil on canvas, 103 x 156 cm	1751	landscape	German	1701-1750
25344-adoratio.jpg	In this work by Mazzolino the sharpness of line typical of the North European tradition is evident. Observe the 'linea serpentinata' with which the fragile figures are constructed. Certain whimsical touches of the narrative are probably due to the influence of a painter like Aspertini, whose presence is also visible in the fairy-tale mountain landscape which can be seen in the background and in the unreal cotton-wool cloud supporting a complex composition of angels in glory	MAZZOLINO, Ludovico	Adoration of the Shepherds	Oil on wood, 79,5 x 60,5 cm	1520-24	religious	Italian	1501-1550
37499-stillif.jpg	Frans Snyders, Rockox's friend and neighbour and a witness to his last will and testament, was the leading still-life and animal painter of his time. His fruitful career was linked in close symbiosis with the artistic world of Rubens, with whom he frequently collaborated. Both the paintings Snyders made alone and those he produced in collaboration with Rubens are so intimately bound up with Rubens' ideas and language of form that they have to be appreciated in this context. Just as in Rubens' work, Snyders assembles the elements of his paintings not only on the basis of their artistic characteristics, but also as elements with a part to play in the overall design and decorative effect of the canvas as a whole. The luxuriant Still-Life is a representative example of Snyders' oeuvre	SNYDERS, Frans	Still-Life	Oil on panel, 74 x 105 cm	1616	still-life	Flemish	1601-1650

Decades previously, Daubigny had bought a plot of land there and tempted Daumier and Corot to follow him. Van Gogh had a tendency to follow in someone or other's footsteps, and in Auvers it was an easy and natural thing to do	GOGH, Vincent van	Houses in Auvers	Oil on canvas, 61 x 73 cm	June 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
26351-poultry.jpg	Market and kitchen scenes originally came from Flemish painting and above all are linked in the sixteenth century with Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. In sharp contrast to Dutch still-life specialists, the Leiden Feinmalers around Gerard Dou reactivated these subjects for their small-format genre paintings, in which market goods were showed off to their best advantage in small, select groups. Metsu's Poultry Seller depicts just such a group of varied items, arranged along the painting's lower and left-hand margins; the precision with which they have been painted testifies to a supreme virtuosity in the Feinmaler style, and is accentuated in part by the use of light and dark contrasts. But importantly, each surface receives the same amount of attention: from different woods - a bamboo rod, basketwork, a barrel and a bare tree &#151; to the fluffy fur of the rabbit beside the pale flesh of the plucked hen in the basket, or from the bird's skeletal head, a strong contrast with the luminous red head of the turkey, to the trader's thick wool stockings that differ so from his young customer's delicate, filmy gauze apron. Metsu is not simply content, however, to use the Feinmalers' technique of applying flat, narrow brush strokes one beside the next. The tree and the row of houses in the background reveal his command of a far more relaxed and expansive style. Furthermore, his colours are richer than those of the Leiden Feinmaler, and reveal a love of clear reds, blues and greens demonstrated, for instance, in the young woman's clothes	METSU, Gabriel	The Poultry Seller	Oil on oak panel, 62 x 46 cm	1662	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

32954-08isaiah.jpg	A new fresco occupied Raphael during the period 1511-1512: the Prophet Isaiah painted for Johannes Goritz of Luxemburg, Head Chancellor of the Papal Court. That the work was commissioned by a foreigner is indicative of the extraordinary fame that Raphael had acquired. This powerful but composed prophet and the putti who surround him echo Michelangelo's figures in the Sistine Ceiling. Nonetheless, the putti, whose glances and poses are enlivened by a strong spiritual tension, are transformed by Raphael into tender and formally controlled children. Even the action of the wind that blows Isaiah's mantle is a life-giving device rather than an expression of dramatic feeling. The dedicatory inscription in Greek (which alludes to St Anne, patron of Goritz) and the Hebrew scroll which the Prophet holds, reflect the learned environment in which the work was conceived.According to Vasari, Raphael repainted it after seeing Michelangelo's prophets. The fresco in later centuries was repainted several times and restored in 1960	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	The Prophet Isaiah	Fresco, 250 x 155 cm	1511-12	religious	Italian	1501-1550
07237-canal606.jpg	This attractive view of the Forum comes from the same series of paintings as The Arch of Constantine. Like the other three works from the group it is prominently signed and dated.The Forum was the site of the political and religious centre of ancient Rome; attempts to excavate it were made throughout the eighteenth century, and the ruins revealed were consistently revered by visitors to the city. The tourists shown here mainly scrutinize the remains of the temple of Castor and Pollux which dominates the foreground. One man, at the right, is so intent upon the ruin that he appears to be ignoring the cleric in black who is attempting to converse with him. Further back, at the left, between the columns can be seen a knife grinder, and over towards the right, the Temple of Saturn. Rising up above it is the Palazzo Senatorio which dominates the Capitoline Hill. These topographical elements have been depicted with considerable care, but elsewhere the artist has taken liberties with his subject - some of the houses at the left are invented, and their chimneys appear characteristically Venetian, rather than Roman.

05757-nicolas.jpg	During a famine, St Nicholas lodged with an inn-keeper who had murdered three children and salted down their dismembered bodies to feed his guests. Nicholas miraculously restored them to life. The story is thought to have arisen out of another concerning three soldiers who were saved by Nicholas from being unjustly executed. In medieval stained glass the soldiers stand in a tower representing their prison. As was the custom, the saint's stature was greatly enlarged in relation to the other figures, which therefore were the size of children, beside him. In due course, when the original legend was forgotten, the story of the school-children was invented to explain the discrepancy in size	BOULLOGNE, Bon	St Nicholas Resuscitates the Children	Oil on canvas, 63 x 39 cm	-	religious	French	1651-1700
07719-5altar4.jpg	The panels depicting St John the Baptist, the Crucifixion, St Peter, and St Francis (now in various museums) once belonged to a single altarpiece, which was a polyptych that consisted of ten panels arranged in two registers. The original location of the polyptych is not known, it comes perhaps from Loreto or from its environment.

23989-3adorat2.jpg	A prodigy, Andrea Mantegna established his reputation when he was barely 20 years old. This painting is an early work, but already his highly individual style is evident. The hard, precise drawing, the astonishing clarity of even the smallest details in the distant landscape, and the refined, pure colour are typical of his work, as are the intensely serious expressions of the figures. The Adoration seems to have been painted for Borso d'Este, ruler of Ferrara, and the coarse realism of the shepherds probably reflects Flemish paintings collected by the Este.In this scene the realistic portrayal of the two shepherds in ragged clothing betrays Flemish influence. Mantegna was able to study the work of Rogier van der Weyden at the Ferrara court	MANTEGNA, Andrea	The Adoration of the Shepherds	Tempera on canvas transferred from wood, 40 x 56 cm	1451-53	religious	Italian	1451-1500

36086-2david4.jpg	The great battle scene on one of the long walls (the chimney wall) is devoted to the death of Saul. According to one version in the Bible, at the end of his reign Saul throws himself upon his sword. According to another version, Saul, leaning on a spear asks a passing Amalekite to kill him. Salviati brings both together in the fresco and shows Saul, pierced by the sword and lying on the ground, as well as the Amalekite, who is pulling out his weapon.In the small image above the battle scene, Salviati depicts Samuel Anoints David. Not shown in the present picture are two further scenes on this wall, Saul with the Witch of Endor, and Saul Tries to Slay David, to the right and left of the battle scene, respectively	SALVIATI, Cecchino del	The Story of David (4 scenes)	Fresco	1552-54	religious	Italian	1501-1550
18582-04mock.jpg	Grünewald's earliest datable work is the Mocking of Christ, a colourful, vehemently expressive painting demonstrating his ability to create dazzling light effects. The painting depicts Christ blindfolded and being beaten by a band of grotesque men. The figures are thick-bodied, soft, and fleshy, done in a manner suggestive of the Italian High Renaissance. Elements of the work also show Grünewald's assimilation of Dürer, specifically his Apocalypse series. Different from High Renaissance idealism and humanism, however, are Grünewald's uses of figural distortion to portray violence and tragedy, thin fluttering drapery, highly contrasting areas of light and shadow, and unusually stark and iridescent colour. It is these elements, already in evidence in this early work, that Grünewald was to develop into the masterful, individualistic style most fully realized in his Isenheim Altarpiece	GRÜNEWALD, Matthias	The Mocking of Christ	Oil on pine panel, 109 x 73,5 cm	1503	religious	German	1501-1550
06177-01right.jpg	The picture shows the right wing of the Dijon Altarpiece.The most distinctive aspect of the Dijon Altarpiece is the arrangement of the sacred architectural settings which occupy virtually all of two out of the four scenes. At the moment of the Annunciation, Mary is sitting in a small pavilion attached to a much larger and much grander building behind. The slender rib vaults, the two windows surmounted by clover-leaf tracery, and the rectangular paving mark the style as Gothic. But the relationship between the pavilion and the surrounding space is unusual, as is the way the room is opened out on two sides in order to afford an unimpeded view of the Virgin.The same is true of the temple in the Presentation of Christ. The Holy Family, St Simeon and a servant girl, who carries a candle in her right hand and a basket with two doves in her left, all gather round the Christ Child. Again, the building in which they stand is open onto the world outside, as if the painter were trying to show us both interior and exterior simultaneously. This apparent contradiction is a convention which Broederlam has borrowed from the paintings of the Italian Trecento, where similar buildings are to be found in the works of Giotto and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, among others	BROEDERLAM, Melchior	Presentation in the Temple and Flight to Egypt	Tempera on wood, 167 x 125 cm	1393-99	religious	Flemish	1351-1400

04753-venus_ad.jpg	The tale of Venus and Adonis is related in the ancient poet Ovid's Metamorphoses. Here the goddess Venus tries in vain to persuade her mortal lover Adonis to refrain from taking part in the dangerous hunt, but in the background we see Adonis having been slain during the hunt.This painting is regarded as one of Bloemaert's masterpieces. The harmony, the intensity of the colours, and the lustre of the classical figures against the contrasting landscape behind it testifies to the quality and longevity. In creating the composition, Bloemaert could look for inspiration in great artists such as Titian and Rubens, who had already painted the motif	BLOEMAERT, Abraham	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 134 x 191 cm	1632	mythological	Dutch	1601-1650
08723-desdemon.jpg	The painting takes its themes from Shakespeare, borrowing the composition that Chassériau established in the eighth of the Othello prints that he engraved in 1844.

19412-stillif7.jpg	This signed and dated still-life of oysters, a nautilus cup, a roemer, lemon and other objects is  a mature work by Heda, incorporating several of the objects and props that fill a number of works from preceding years, such as the elaborate mother-of-pearl nautilus cup.

00418-4saints2.jpg	The first two pictures, dedicated to St Catherine, are in very poor condition; they show the saint appearing before Emperor Maxentius to condemn idolatry and her dispute with the philosophers summoned by the emperor and their conversion. These scenes are followed by the picture of an angel intervening to prevent Catherine's torture on the wheel and the beheading of the saint. Both scenes have parallels in the St George cycle, here, however, an oriental milieu, seen in the physiognomies, head coverings, and scimitars, is emphasized still more	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	The Beheading of St Catherine	Fresco	1378-84	religious	Italian	1351-1400
40899-10sorrow.jpg	The representation is a development of the Man of Sorrows either or not in the company of the Virgin. As mourning emblems of the Deposition the figures of the Virgin Mary, John, Mary Magdalene and a holy woman are grouped around the dead body of Christ, who is nevertheless showing his wounds like a living person. It is a devotional subject. Two angels are holding the sponge and the lance. Under the Cross are the instruments and symbols of the Passion, such as the ladder, the Flagellation column, the scourge, Judas' silver coins, the holy women's vases, the hammer and the dice.The painting is the work of an anonymous Memling follower. It is not probable that the composition reflects a lost Memling	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Man of Sorrows with Mary and John and Two Holy Women	Oil on oak panel, 49,1 x 41,9 cm (original frame)	1495-1505	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

33534-45portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 101.Rembrandt married on June 22, 1634. His bride was Saskia Uylenburgh (born in 1612), the cousin of Hendrick Uylenburgh and the daughter of the burgomaster of Leeuwarden. Saskia brought a substantial dowry as well as patrician status with her, so this marriage represented a substantial climb in social status for Rembrandt.Saskia was to be the subject of the largest number of single portraits during the 1630s. Rembrandt posed her in mythological dress, particularly in the flower-draped abundance of the goddess Flora (1634), and in formal attire with fastidious profile. But he also delighted in using her as his subject in a cluster of spontaneous domestic drawings, such as those catching her leaning out of a window or lying in bed. Some of the unhappy biographical data make the scenes in bed poignant: Saskia lost three children before the birth of a son, Titus, in 1641.

08170-pyrrha.jpg	The story of a great flood occurs in the mythology of many races. The Greek version (Met. 1:348-415) tells of Deucalion, son of Prometheus, who, like Noah, escaped the destruction that overtook the rest of mankind by building an ark in which he floated for nine days with his wife Pyrrha. After the waters had subsided they were advised by an oracle to veil their heads and 'throw the bones of your great mother behind you', which they took to mean the rocks of Mother Earth. They did as they were bid, the rocks which Deucalion threw turning into men and Pyrrha's into women. Thus a new human race was created.In the painting Pyrrha and Deucalion are shown in the act of casting the rocks. On the ground rocks change into men and women who scramble to their feet	CASTIGLIONE, Giovanni Benedetto	Pyrrha and Deucalion	Oil on canvas, 83 x 107 cm	1655	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

31066-2august3.jpg	In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St John the Evangelist was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).Against a background which is a realistically constructed space with a marble balustrade stands the figure of St John. It is dynamic yet elegant. His lined face, surrounded by white hair, his bony hand weighted down by the heavy book, even the ornate borders of the garment that unexpectedly shows through under the wide cloak, are elements that stand out and appear to force their way through Piero's earlier sense of measure.The bright colours on this panel are the result of a recent restoration	PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA	Polyptych of St Augustine: St John the Evangelist	Tempera on panel, 132 x 58 cm	c. 1460	religious	Italian	1451-1500

37552-scene33.jpg	Scene 33 of the cycle on the life of St Benedict depicts as Benedict gives posthumous absolution to two nuns, fleeing from their graves during Mass, whom he had threatened with excommunication.One notable scene of the cycle is devoted to the story of two haughty and talkative nuns whom Benedict had threatened with excommunication (Scene 33). Both died soon afterward, and during Mass their nurse saw how they rose up out of their graves and fled from the church. Benedict promptly administered the host to the errant souls, thereby luring them back into the bosom of the community.The composition of this scene is clearly indebted to Pinturicchio's cycle in the Piccolomini Library in Siena. The shape of the interior and arrangement of the picture space are borrowed from the scene of Enea Silvio Piccolomini's coronation as Pius II, whereas the grouping of figures, especially that of the ones seen from the back in the foreground, recall the scene in which Piccolomini is elevated to the rank of cardinal	SODOMA, Il	Life of St Benedict, Scene 33: Benedict Gives Posthumous Absolution to Two Nuns	Fresco	1505-08	religious	Italian	1501-1550
04026-4buda.jpg	"Benczúr started to paint ""The Recapture of Buda Castle in 1686"" in 1885; the composition was completed for the Millennial Celebrations in 1896. This huge painting was the last such venture of Benczúr and of Hungarian Historical painting in general, since by the turn of the century this genre became out of date. The composition implies the historical necessity of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by emphasizing that Hungary was freed from Turkish suzerainty in 1686-1687 by the help of Karl of Lotharingia and Eugene of Savoy. Benczúr groups the figures ingeniously; thus, in spite of the numerous characters, the presentation still remains fluent. The careful studies of costumes, props and faces, and their realistic and colourful rendering, were required to establish the historical authenticity of the final work"	BENCZÚR, Gyula	The Recapture of Buda Castle in 1686	Oil on canvas, 356 x 705 cm	1896	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

42266-0601vela.jpg	As a court painter, Velázquez was required to paint group portraits as well as these actual or fictional portraits of individual figures. He organized a workshop of competent artists, and in 1633 recruited the services of his son-in-law Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo. Mazo probably did a good deal of work on the picture of around 1636 showing Prince Baltasar Carlos with the Count-Duke of Olivares at the Royal Mews. The Count-Duke stands in the middle ground to the right of the picture, with his master-at-arms; figures on the balcony above him include Philip IV, Queen Isabel and several courtiers who cannot be identified for certain.The belly of the horse on which the little prince is mounted is disproportionately convex and in fact so coarsely depicted that one suspects the unskilful hand of an apprentice rather than a deliberate distortion	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Prince Baltasar Carlos with the Count-Duke of Olivares at the Royal Mews	Oil on canvas, 144 x 96,5 cm	c. 1636	other	Spanish	1601-1650

29201-11munkac.jpg	Munkácsy often spent the summer at his wife's estate in Colpach. Colpach Castle, located in Colpach-Bas near Ell in western Luxembourg, dates from the beginning of the 14th century. The castle was originally a small medieval stronghold surrounded by a moat, it was adapted as a manor house in the 18th century. In about 1870, Baron Edouard de Marches, the first husband of Munkácsy's wife, laid out the gardens surrounding the castle. Munkácsy and his wife spent their summers in Colpach Castle and the winters in Paris.Munkácsy painted this landscape in Colpach. Partially  owing to the influence of László Paál, Munkácsy's landscape painting started to bloom during the 1880s. This painting is also closely related to Paál's intimate and lyrical landscapes. The light is sifting through the foliage, radiating intimacy: the multitude of hues and tones within the brown basic colour make the painting exciting	MUNKÁCSY, Mihály	Line of Trees	Oil on canvas, 112 x 182 cm	1886	landscape	Hungarian	1851-1900

14089-ursins.jpg	This is the portrait of Fouquet's that most strongly reflects the spirit of the Renaissance. The subject of the portrait was a powerful lord, the Chancellor of France of both Charles VII and Louis XI, one of the leading notabilities of France. The background, composed of Renaissance architecture with lavish gilded panellings inlaid with marble fillings displays an Italian influence. Against this background the monumental figure of the Chancellor kneels in prayer before a lectern, on which a great folio lies open on a cushion of red, white and yellow stripes. The red of his robe, trimmed with brown fur at the neck and sleeves, is reflected in the heavy, fleshy face of the Chancellor, on his thin lips, and on the head, which combines an overall impression of strength, intelligence and extraordinary dignity. The decorative harmony of the red and gold in which his head is framed only serves to enhance the imposing effect of the whole figure. With this portrait Fouquet earns his place as a fit contemporary of the great masters of the Italian Quattrocento, Andrea Mantegna, Piero della Francesca and Antonello da Messina	FOUQUET, Jean	Portrait of Guillaume Jouvenel des Ursins	Wood, 93 x 73 cm	c. 1455	portrait	French	1451-1500

07463-06concer.jpg	The two figures seen frontally are undoubtably portraits, and this fact disorients those who would like to make a conventional reading of the scene and concentrate on the noble, classical character of the composition, organized around the traditional opposition between the figure of the lute player and the corresponding figure whom we see from behind. The face between these two is Caravaggio's; the figure on the left is taken from an earlier composition (Young Peeling a Pear) which we know only from copies.

28460-helicon.jpg	This painting is the result of a co-operation of three artists, Joos de Momper (landscape), Hendrik van Balen (figures) and Jan 'Velvet' Brueghel (flowers). It is an attractive work with a harmonious landscape. The foreground and background merge gradually with one another, forbidding rocks give way to a grand valley, in which the mythological scene forms a balanced component.Ovid describes (Met. 5:250-268) how Minerva visited the Muses on Mt Helicon, their home, to listen to their song and story and to see the sacred spring, the Hippocrene, which flowed from a rock after it had been struck by the hoof of the winged horse, Pegasus. The scene is a wooded mountain-side where the company of Muses are playing their instruments. Pegasus is seen in the background leaping from a high rock from which water gushes.

41386-10colom1.jpg	The three panels in the Brera painted by an anonymous follower of Giotto, representing scenes from the life of St Colomba, belonged to a triptych, probably executed for the old cathedral of Rimini, dedicated to St Colomba and demolished in 1815. According to a plausible theory that is not universally accepted by scholars, the panels belonged to a double-faced composition placed on the high altar of the cathedral. Other panels of this work are in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris; the Galleria Sabauda, Turin; and the Friedenthal collection, Ingenheim.St Colomba, the virgin of Sens, was martyred during the reign of the Emperor Aurelian. Confined in a house of prostitution, she was rescued from dishonour by a bear. The same animal saved her again when an attempt was made to kill her by burning down the cell in which she was locked. Finally, the Emperor - instigated by the devil - had her dragged out of town, where she was beheaded by the soldiers.In the three small panels in the Brera, the main episodes in this legend are represented with subtle variations in composition and rhythm. In St Colomba before the Emperor the courtyard is shown frontally, and the foreshortening of the architecture does not follow a unified perspective scheme. The splaying out of the sides appears to enlarge the ground on which the motionless figures stand	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Scenes from the Life of St Colomba (St Colomba before the Emperor)	Tempera on panel, 55 x 55 cm	c. 1340	religious	Italian	1301-1350
04685-portgent.jpg	During the eighteenth century portraiture in Rome developed a distinctive, cosmopolitan style as practitioners from outside the city dominated the field: the Frenchman Pierre Subleyras, the Lucchese Pompeo Batoni, the Bohemian Anton Raphael Mengs and Austrian Anton von Maron. One reason for this diversity was Rome's prominence as a place of artistic and educational pilgrimage for young artists and travellers from other European nations undertaking the 'Grand Tour'.The painting probably depicts a foreign visitor to Rome proudly holding a book, a prop suggestive of both learning and the implicit educational function of travel in the mid-eighteenth century.The portrait is illustrative of both the distinctive Roman style and mode of 'Grand Tour' portraiture	BLANCHET, Louis-Gabriel	Portrait of a Gentleman	Oil on canvas, 99 x 74 cm	-	portrait	French	1701-1750

12498-12krel.jpg	"Inscription in the top left by someone else (?): OSWOLT KREL 1499.This portrait comes from the collection of the Princes Oettingen-Wallerstein, who had acquired it in 1812; if has been in its present location since 1928. It is presumed that Oswolt Krell, a merchant for the Ravensburg House in Nuremberg from 1495 to 1503, had asked the artist for a true portrait of representation. Its notable size, similar to that adopted by Dürer for the portrait of his father two years earlier, and its setting, a half-length, suggests this. In this way, it differs from the Tucher portraits, which were intended for private use.The background, as in the Tucher portraits (Schlossmuseum, Weimar), is divided between the curtain and landscape passage, unlike those, however, it is divided rather unevenly. The bright red curtain is wide and occupies most of the space on the right; the landscape, on the left, is reduced to a foreshortening that shows a small part of a river that meanders toward the back, behind a group of tall trees. The windowsill that separated the subject from the landscape in the Tucher paintings is absent. The figure represented, set with obvious grandiosity, is found in front of the curtain, highlighted by intense colour.The large fur-lined cloak is casually placed on the right shoulder only, to show, on the left side, the rich black garment with the puffed sleeve. To the disorderly folds of the cloak correspond the parallel horizontal folds of the sleeve and the vertical ones of the garment. The three-quarter position allows the painter to bring out the quality of the attire: the fur, silk shirt, and gold chain. The careful, fastidious representation of these meaningful details creates a powerful foundation for the setting of the head: vigorous, strong features, the pronounced nose and the strong-willed mouth, the furrowed eyebrows, as if from a sudden start or fright that makes him direct his gaze off to the side behind him. Everything works to make his face threateningly severe, which even the soft, light brown hair framing him does not attenuate. To the energetic expression of the face corresponds the nervous look of his left hand clutching his cloak and that of the contraction of the knotted fingers of the right hand that leans on an invisible window sill.Colour, form, and proportion heighten the expression of supreme resolution, an expression that is the result of a serious psychological study that Dürer conducted on the merchant, who was the same age as the artist and who was later to become the mayor of Lindau, his native city.The two side panels that represent two ""sylvan men"" are wings to the portrait. They bear the heraldic shields of the subject and his wife, Agathe von Esendorf. They originally let the portrait be closed from the retro; one could imagine, then, that despite the large dimensions, the painting was to be conserved closed.

07251-canal701.jpg	Canaletto is first recorded in England in spring 1746, and his earliest paintings of London are depictions of the new Westminster Bridge, a subject he was to portray from various vantage points. The bridge was not actually completed until four years after this work was painted.In this picture he combines a view of its whole span with a depiction of festivities, which, although tamer than the Venetian spectacles he generally painted, partially recall them. The celebrations accompanied the appointment of the new Lord Mayor of London. The largest City Barge is shown taking him to Westminster Hall, by the Abbey at the right, where he will be sworn in. The prominent building on the horizon to the left of it is St John's Church, Smith Square, and over on the other side of the river is Lambeth Palace, the London home of the Archbishop of Canterbury. All the other spectacular barges are those of the different city guilds (Skinners, Goldsmiths, Fishmongers, Clothworkers, Vinters, Merchant Taylors, Mercers and Dyers); a number of them are firing salutes to honour the Mayor. In order to encapsulate all of this activity within such a broad panorama Canaletto has adopted an imaginary vantage point high above the Thames	CANALETTO	London: Westminster Bridge from the North on Lord Mayor's Day	Oil on canvas, 96 x 137,5 cm	1746	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

14246-4madonna.jpg	Francesco di Giorgio Martini was a multifaceted artist who embodied the spirit of Renaissance Humanism: an architect, sculpture, miniatur and painter. He preferred to work as an architect and a designer of forfications, as in his work at Urbino, and he collaborated on the building of Siena cathedral. He also wrote a treatise on civil and military architecture.His painted oeuvre is sporadic, and employs a soft and delicate style which may recall Botticelli, although some experts have seen the influence of Verrocchio in the lightness, grace and elegance of the poses, together with the high degree of finish	FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI	Madonna and Child with Two Angels	Panel, 73 x 46 cm	1465-66	religious	Italian	1451-1500
25971-04notri.jpg	Memling must have started work on his wide Adoration of the Magi triptych shortly after finishing the Portinari panels. This altarpiece too was probably commissioned by Abbot Jan Crabbe, as the old woman and young man from the earlier Crucifixion triptych once again appear together. Like the Last Judgment, this triptych relies on both Van der Weyden and Lochner, despite its highly personal, peculiar and ceremonial atmosphere. The conception of the work owes a great deal to Rogier's Columba altarpiece (Munich, Alte Pinakothek), which Memling must have seen during production in the master's workshop. Meanwhile, the highly centralized, symmetrical composition looks back to Stefan Lochner's even earlier Dombild (Cologne, Cathedral) .The triptych depicts the Nativity (left), the Adoration of the Magi (central) and the Presentation of the Temple (right)	MEMLING, Hans	Triptych	Oil on wood, 96,4 x 147 cm (central), 98 x 63,5 cm (each wing)	c. 1470	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

34181-0taste.jpg	Ribera's stay in Rome lasted only a few years. Only a handful of pictures from his Roman period has been identified, of which the most important is a set of the Five Senses, supposedly made for a Spanish client. The Sense of Taste, which typifies these pictures, is an ingenious representation of a theme made popular in the Netherlands during the late sixteenth century. Northern artists treated the subject as an allegory with classicising figures. However, Ribera rejects this model and takes a direct, naturalistic approach, embodying the sense of taste  in a beefy, gluttonous type, poised to descent on a bowl of pasta and wash  it down with a jug of wine	RIBERA, Jusepe de	Sense of Taste	Oil on canvas, 117 x 88 cm	1613-16	mythological	Spanish	1601-1650
34303-maruce03.jpg	The largest room on the ground floor is the Sala d'Ercole, a hall with two window bays. It has three entrances and presents an elaborate painted decoration extending across all four walls and the entire ceiling. The decoration was executed with the collaboration of Giuseppe Tonelli (1668-1732), one of the best known quadratura painters in Florence. The pictorial program contains the Labours and Apotheosis of Hercules.A simple, rhythmic arrangement of columns, backed by a gilt ground, structures all four walls in the room. On three sides it is interrupted by a large, arched centre opening. The compositions for these imaginary openings are three of Hercules's more significant labours. Prominent on the end wall is the depiction of the young Hercules at the Crossroads between Vice and Virtue, the other two openings contains Hercules and Cacus, and Hercules and Nessus. On the window wall a painted sculpture depicting Hercules and Antheus can be found.In the Sala d'Ercole Ricci's fluid, elegant, and atmospheric style attains a brilliance and airiness that set him apart from all his famous contemporaries, and has been shown to anticipate features of Rococo painting	RICCI, Sebastiano	Hercules at the Crossroads	Fresco	1706-07	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

22614-01annun.jpg	The provenance of this panel has been connected to the Church of Sant'Egidio in Florence. At some point, the painting was probably cut down on the left side. On the basis of the hypothetical identification of the portrayed donors as Andrea and Lorenzo d'Ilarione de' Bardi, early scholars assumed that the picture could date to no earlier than 1452, and more likely to a bit later. Successive art historians have moved the painting to the early 1440's, comparing it to the Annunciation in Munich and recognizing in it the beginnings of Lippi's attachment to the style of Fra Angelico. The participation of Andrea del Castagno has also been suggested, with a date of around 1440. The portraits of the donors, more recently identified as Folco Portinari and Folgonaccio, were probably carried out with the help of an assistant	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	Annunciation with two Kneeling Donors	Oil on panel, 155 x 144 cm	c. 1440	religious	Italian	1401-1450

35933-1assende.jpg	Pieter Saenredam broke with the tradition of the fantasy architecture piece. It was a genre that arose in Antwerp at the end of the 16th century, and was still being practiced by several of Saenredam's contemporaries in the northern Netherlands. He also abandoned the custom of using the architectural space as a mere backdrop to religious or secular subjects. Instead he painted the 'portrait' of a building for the sake of its intrinsic qualities. The sole purpose of the few people in his paintings appears to be indicate the scale	SAENREDAM, Pieter Jansz	Interior of the Church of St Odulphus, Assendelft	Oil on panel, 50 x 76 cm	1649	interior	Dutch	1601-1650

05281-8lastjud.jpg	The triptych of the Last Judgment is a fascinating work of art which comes surprisingly close to the unmistakable style of the strange moralist from 's-Hertogenbosch. The emphasis in the development of the theme is on the all-besetting evil and perennial human stupidity that render the world a hell even before the day of divine jjudgment. The extraordinary combination of motifs is often derived from vernacular symbolism and imagery: The inventive use of colours and the sharp, supple brushwork have persuaded many critics that Bosch himself was the author of this painting. In spite of the work's pictorial qualities, several factors seem to undermine this attribution. Nevertheless, the triptych remains an important example of Boschian invention. It dates from the early sixteenth century.At the time of his death, Bosch was internationally celebrated as an eccentric painter of religious visions who dealt in particular with the torments of hell. During his lifetime Bosch's works were in the inventories of noble families of the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and they were imitated in a number of paintings and prints throughout the 16th century, especially in the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

16511-0baronce.jpg	The original frame of this five-part altarpiece no longer survives. Beneath the central panel the altar is described as OPUS MAGISTRI JOCTI (Work of the Master Giotto). Many angels and saints have come together in a radiant assembly. They all want to be part of the coronation of the Mother of God by her son. In the rows at the front kneeling angels make music, in those at the back the looks and gestures of those present are oriented towards the central event.Both the highly packed hosts of angels praising the Virgin and the huge figures in the central panel indicate that considerable assistance was needed for this work. Giotto no longer worked with a few individual assistants, but now had a well-organized studio.

29192-02munkac.jpg	"The outlaw's life and figure was a major concern for Munkácsy ever since his childhood. It is known from his ""Memoirs"" that  he suffered much during the years of apprenticeship and that he always  wanted to see a living outlaw as a symbol of free life even  if he had to wait for him under a table in the inn.In the drama of  ""Condemned Cell"", he painted the embarrassed apprentice. Munkácsy had followed the life of his hero in his earliest genre pictures painted in 1867 or illustrations for journals. He needed an immense amount of skill in order to paint a true picture of a man condemned to death who had been given proper food and looked after for three days, and then his family, friends and enemies were to come to say good-bye to him. His wife is sobbing her heart out in a corner, his little daughter is pottering about not knowing what is going on and she is munching something. The outlaw must have resigned to his lot and has nothing more to expect of life: he throws the Bible to the ground.

12486-01father.jpg	The portrait is inscribed `1497 Albrecht Dürer the Elder at age 70'. Dürer's father appears considerably older than in the portrait of seven years earlier. His lips are thinner, his face more heavily lined with wrinkles and his narrow eyes have a wearier appearance. Yet Albrecht the Elder has retained his wisdom and dignity. After his death, Dürer wrote that his father `passed his life in great toil and stern, hard labour...He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities.' Albrecht the Elder died five years after this portrait was painted, at the age of 75.The condition of this painting is poor, particularly in the background and the cloak, and in the past many scholars believed that it was a copy of a lost original. However, since it was cleaned in 1955, there has been more support for the view that this is indeed the original. Fortunately the face is the part of the picture which remains in the best condition.This portrait may originally have been displayed with Dürer's self-portrait of the following year, either hung in the same room in the family home or even linked as a diptych. Although Dürer and his father are wearing very different clothing and the backgrounds do not match, the two portraits are almost the same size and the half length poses are similar. The pictures were apparently kept together as a pair, since they were presented by the city of Nuremberg to the Earl of Arundel in 1636 as a gift for Charles I of England. Both paintings were sold in 1650 by Cromwell. The portrait of Albrecht Dürer the Elder stayed in Britain and was eventually bought by the National Gallery in 1904	DÜRER, Albrecht	Portrait of Dürer's Father at 70	Oil on panel, 51 x 40 cm	1497	portrait	German	1501-1550
26361-writing2.jpg	Metsu's indisputable masterpieces are Man Writing a Letter and Woman Reading a Letter which were painted as companion pieces. In both paintings, the way the silvery daylight flows over the figures set against light walls is not surpassed by Vermeer. The pendants offer a small drama: the handsome man writes a letter, and its patient recipient attentively reads it by the light of a window. Here letter writing and reading are most likely associated with love. The discreet waiting maid pulls aside a curtain hanging from a rod to reveal a choppy seascape, possibly but not demonstrably a reference to the popular adage that love is as hazardous as a sea voyage. The maid's momentary movement contrasts with the concentration of the young woman who, one senses, will not move until she has finished reading the letter.The curtain over the painting is not an unusual detail. The Dutch often protected paintings with curtains, either to keep off the light and dust, or to look at them only occasionally, as is the traditional way of the Chinese and, Japanese - a practice that comes from the fine feeling that a work of art cannot be looked at continually. Trompe l'oeil curtains on rods painted to give the illusion that they have been drawn aside to reveal a framed picture are not uncommon either; best known is the one Rembrandt included in his intimate Holy Family at Kassel	METSU, Gabriel	Woman Reading a Letter	Oil on panel, 53 x 40 cm	1662-65	interior	Dutch	1651-1700

41361-07sancta.jpg	Sts Lawrence and Stephen were venerated throughout Rome and the popes accorded them particular honour. Their martyrdoms were frescoed in the private papal chapel known as the Sancta Sanctorum (Holy of Holies) in the Lateran Palace, the official residence of the popes through the end of the Great Schism. The chapel was commissioned by Pope Nicholas III (reigned 1276-80). It preserved the miraculous, painted portrait of Christ, believed to have been completed by angels, and some of the most treasured relics from the Holy Land, including a coal from the fire that roasted Lawrence and drops of Stephen's blood	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Martyrdom of St Stephen and Martyrdom of St Lawrence (west wall)	Fresco	1278-79	religious	Italian	1251-1300

39669-08thief.jpg	There is considerable disagreement about the attribution of this work to Titian. While the manner in which the colours are applied is reminiscent of his late work, the extraordinary spatial effect, which is mainly produced by the turning of the thief's cross, can be observed in none of his later works. The way the light falls would also be an unusual feature in Titian's works in the 1560s. If this indeed is not one of his paintings, it is nonetheless one of the highest quality examples of the adoption of elements of his style by other artists	TIZIANO Vecellio	Christ and the Good Thief	Oil on canvas, 137 x 149 cm	c. 1566	religious	Italian	1501-1550

35438-70religi.jpg	An extremely valuable work is housed in Santa Maria del Giglio: a Virgin and Child with the Infant St John by Rubens, the only painting by this artist in Venice. The central section on paper is by Rubens, and this is fixed onto canvas and connect- ed to a generic background comprising a tree and curtain hanging on the right, by a late seventeenth-century painter probably from the Veneto.Despite its critical vicissitudes over the centuries, there is no lack of elements substantiating the author of the painting and its very high quality: the brilliant quality of the afresh tones, especially in the children; the emotional intensity of the looks; the material richness and the expert technique evident in the several tones of Titian-style red on which the chromatic distribution of the entire fragment is based. Deep layers of solid and glazed lacquer are superimposed, often tone on tone and finely touched, from the clothes of the Virgin shaded in the grey filaments and earth green of the veil falling on her neck, to the profiles and extremely tender tips of the two children's fingers, heightened in white with the tip of the brush. Then there is the skillful painting of the Virgin's ear and of every other element in the work; the power of invention and of colour evident in the small patch of sky; the effect of shaping on form, seen in the facial features and breast of the Virgin, portrayed to great plastic effect, and partly the entire placement of the figures and overall composition, sensitive to the lessons of Caravaggio	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Virgin and Child with the Infant St John	Oil on paper fixed onto canvas	-	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
43912-banks.jpg	Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) was a naturalist and patron of science. From an early age, his declared passion was natural history, and in particular, botany.

20820-runningb.jpg	The painting depicts young nobleman, Marcus Pauli Holst von Schmidten, dashing off to school.

The school did pioneering work to give children the opportunity to play and do athletics in the open air. The school's playground was the first to be built in Denmark.The young nobleman is seen running on his way to school; his school is glimpsed in the background. The boy's figure is simultaneously in movement and in balance. It is one of few examples of a figure in movement in Juel's mature work. An engraving after the American painter Gilbert Stuart's The Skater (Washington, National Gallery of Art) may have served as inspiration for this painting	JUEL, Jens J?rgensen	A Running Boy	Oil on canvas, 181 x 126 cm	1802	genre	Danish	1751-1800
13165-christ_t.jpg	Cornelis Engebrechtsz. headed a large painters' workshop in the first decades of the 16th century, and trained Lucas van Leyden, Aertgen van Leyden and his own three sons, Pieter Cornelisz, Cornelis Cornelisz and Lucas Cornelisz. He and his pupils and assistants produced altarpieces and numerous smaller works for private devotion. One of his chief patrons was the Augustinian nunnery of Mari&#235;npoel just north of Leiden. Among the works he made for the convent church were altarpieces with the Lamentation (c. 1508) and the Crucifixion (c. 1517), which were described by Karel van Mander in 1604 and are now in Leiden's Museum de Lakenhal.The Amsterdam painting undoubtedly comes from an altarpiece illustrating episodes from the life of the Virgin. It was recognised as Engelbrechtsz.'s work in 1904, and shortly afterwards the Rijksmuseum was able to acquire a second, less well-preserved panel from the same altarpiece: Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.The events depicted in the two panels are not found in the Bible but in the popular late-medieval Meditationes vitae Christi. Both scenes precede the Arrest of Christ. In the conversation with his mother and Mary Magdalen, Christ refused to abandon his planned visit to Jerusalem during the Jewish Passover, and foretold his impending death.The second panel shows Christ taking leave of his mother, immediately before he and his disciples set off for Jerusalem. Movingly he embraces the kneeling Virgin amidst the sorrowful Marys and the apostles. Some of the disciples are descending into the valley on the right, with the city gate and walls of Jerusalem in the distance.The attribution of the panels to Engelbrechtsz., based partly on the correspondences in style, colouring and manner of execution with the Crucifixion triptych in Leiden, was recently confirmed by an examination of the two underdrawings using infrared reflectography. This painting is a fine example of the artist's more mature work. The poses and gestures in the figure group highlight the emotional nature of the leave-taking. The landscape and city in the background are painted in a surprisingly lively way. The steely, blue-white shapes of the mountains and rock formations contrast with the warm, bright colouring of the figures in the foreground. The attention paid to ornamental details, which was relatively slight by the standards of the day, and the broad manner of painting, which fades to the sketchy in the background, are typical of the work of Engelbrechtsz. and of the Leiden painters he trained	ENGEBRECHTSZ., Cornelis	Christ Taking Leave of his Mother	Oil on panel, 55 x 43 cm	c. 1515	religious	Netherlandish	1501-1550

The subject of music in painting had always been represented since the 16th century but it was in Rome, at the time of Caravaggio, that these scenes changed dramatically and that music per se became the central theme of pictures. Here the lute-player and singer each play and sing convincingly, and Régnier's accuracy in depicting both the instrument and the musical scores is impressive.

34655-louvre1.jpg	"French painting in the second half of the 18th century displays the overlapping or intermingling of pre-Romantic and Neoclassical pictorial ideas, and nowhere is this clearer than in the work of the 'painter of ruins', Hubert Robert. He obtained his ideas from Italy, where he admired the paintings of ruins by Giovanni Paolo Pannini, and witnessed the first excavations in Pompeii. Praised by Diderot, he was immediately consulted when antique pieces were to be placed in the park of Versailles. But his great work was the realization of the Louvre Museum. A comparison of two of his paintings, the first showing a ruined barrel-vault hall, and the second the Grande Galerie in the Louvre, immediately reveals the source of the idea for the top lighting and the ""antique effect"" that the newly designed gallery is open to the sky. The sublimity of antique ruins was to be transferred to the real building, and this in turn was to be a treasure chest of art and a worthy successor to its antique models"	ROBERT, Hubert	Imaginary View of the Grande Galerie in the Louvre in Ruins	Oil on canvas, 114,5 x 146 cm	1796	other	French	1751-1800

25255-innocent.jpg	Matteo di Giovanni is best known for four monumental compositions of the Massacre of the Innocents, three for Sienese churches and one in inlaid stone for the pavement of the Duomo. In the version in Sant'Agostino, the arches and columns of Herod's palace suggest that the artist  had visited Rome. He has left no foreground space and every inch of Herod's hall is occupied by screaming mothers, dead or dying babies, and bloodthirsty soldiers. The marble pavement is covered by infant corpses. Impassive courtiers flank Herod's throne, while the gloating king is portrayed as a monster: one hand is outstretched to order the butchery; the other, like a claw, clutches the marble sphinx on the arm of his throne	MATTEO di Giovanni	Massacre of the Innocents	Panel, 240 x 240 cm	1482	religious	Italian	1451-1500

33357-meeting.jpg	Reichlich was a Tirolian artist, who worked together with Michael Pacher in Salzburg from 1485. He used very expressive colours and by this he exerted great influence on contemporary painters. In his paintings - usually pictures of donors or altarpieces - contemporary details and Tirolian landscapes can be observed.The picture shown is one of the four panels of an altarpiece	REICHLICH, Marx	Meeting of Mary and Elisabeth	Wood, 100,5 x 81,2 cm	-	religious	Austrian	1501-1550
17508-17virgin.jpg	This panel was probably the left half of a diptych, the right half with probably a praying donor has not survived. The most interesting feature of the painting is the Virgin's particularly contemplative mood and pose. The gesture of a figure with head in hand goes back to antiquity, and Renaissance examples featured Christ, Job, and St Jerome among others in this pose of contemplation. Gossart's painting was probably influenced by Dürer's St Jerome, or his Madonna of the Pear, which may have been in the Netherlands during Gossart's lifetime.The pastoral setting of the Virgin and Child is unique in Gossart's surviving work. Gossart apparently regularly employed landscape specialists to collaborate with him, the landscape in this panel was probably painted by such a specialist. The Master of the Female Half-Lengths, a close follower of Patenier, is the likely painter who added the landscape behind the figures	GOSSART, Jan	Virgin and Child in a Landscape	Oil on oak panel, 50 x 38 cm (without frame)	1531	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
15987-51border.jpg	The four fields in the crossing vault of the lower church are framed by broad, heavily ornamented borders with diamond-shaped, small format picture fields, all filled with motifs from the Apocalypse. The focus of this subsidiary pictorial program, which was probably inspired by Bonaventura's interpretation of St Francis as the angel of the sixth seal, is the Apocalyptic Christ in the capstone of the crossing vault, from whose mouth two swords emerge and whose head, with sweeping white hair, bears a crown. In his right hand he holds the book of divine wisdom with seven seals, toward which the Lamb of God is approaching from the side; in his right hand he is raising a double-bit key.Above Christ, the Lamb of God (at left), and the Arc of the Covenant (at right) are depicted	GIOTTO di Bondone	Apocalyptic Christ	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350

On the other side is the curious image of a man who has put a bridle on a woman.

43209-martyrdo.jpg	Vignon probably worked in Rome from around 1617 to 1623. This painting is based on Caravaggio's Martyrdom of St Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi.The domineering executioner seen from the front seems to be a direct borrowing.

41327-03crucif.jpg	"The exact identification of the names of the two painters, active in Umbria during the middle of the thirteenth century was discovered in 1948. The painting is signed and dated at the foot of the cross: ""Simone et Machilon pinserunt Hoc opus Anno Domini MCCLVII Domina Maria fieri Fecit"". Because it is one of the very few dated crosses from its period, this panel is an important reference point for the chronological reconstruction of thirteenth century central Italian workshop activity.Stylistically, the design follows the Giunta Pisano Crucifix in the church of San Domenico in Bologna, datable to around 1250 and the known prototype for a number of late thirteenth century crosses. This series has its finest expression in the Crucifix that Cimabue painted for Santa Croce in around 1287-88. Yet though they adhere strictly to the model of Giunta, especially in iconographic aspects, Simone and Machilone show some original characteristics, above all in the attenuation and hardness of line in the figure of Christ, less severe and more human in the National Gallery cross. Likewise, Simone and Machilone render anatomic details less schematically than their prototype. From Giunta, on the other hand, the artists inherit the languid abandon of the dead body of Christ, which they interpret with perfect mastery. Also masterfully rendered is the complex Hebraic drapery wrapped around the body, different from the brown drapery of Giunta's Christ, which provided the prototype for another Cross, attributed to Coppo di Marcovaldo, in the Pinacoteca of San Gimignano."

30009-lottery.jpg	Isaak Ouwater was the best follower of Jan van der Heyden. He concentrated on cityscapes. Although Ouwater's paintings can be a little dry and airless, and, when compared to to van der Heyden's, appear timid, he always displays a fine sense of design as is evident in his Lottery Office.Here his debt to van der Heyden's execution also is unmistakable; in it his minute handling is best enjoyed with a magnifying glass. But his close, frontal view of the street scene is original. The painting is an exact rendering of the façades of three houses in the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam which have an antiquarian interest that enhances the painting's historical value. The lottery office that the crowd is trying to enter was first inhabited by Clement de Jonghe, who posed for Rembrandt and was a publisher of Rembrandt's etchings. The house on the right was once occupied by Jacob van Ruisdael, the one on the left by Aert van der Neer	OUWATER, Isaak	The Lottery Office	Oil on canvas	1779	other	Dutch	1751-1800
06394-20dulle.jpg	This painting was mentioned by Carel van Mander in 1604 in his 'Schilderboeck'. He described the principal character of the painting as 'a Mad Meg pillaging at the mouth of Hell / seemingly perplexed / and cruelly and strangely attired', an evil and fearsome woman or witch. Van Mander remained vague about the actual significance of the painting. Perhaps it had already been forgotten by his time. We can be certain, however, that Bruegel gave the work a hidden allegorical or religious meaning, albeit one that remains a mystery. A great many experts have devoted their energies to solving the problem, but none has ever succeeded entirely in explaining the painting. Most of them focus on the possible symbolism of the large woman in the foreground, with her suit of armor, sword, cutlery and money-box. She has been variously interpreted as a symbol of heresy or violence, the personification of hum,an evil and an allegory of instability.Recently it was proposed that Meg symbolizes Madness, a vice taken in the 16th century to include insanity, rage, gluttony, lust, avarice and ambition, and that the giant figure in the centre of the painting is an allegory of Folly. The additional scenes surrounding the two figures illustrate the causes and repercussions of these two human failings. It was concluded that Bruegel's allegory was intended as an attack on both human nature and the political and religious situation in 16th-century Antwerp.We could fill a book with suggested interpretations of Mad Meg and it is highly doubtful whether it would bring the viewer any closer to the true meaning of the painting. Nevertheless, the work never fails to fascinate, even without specialist knowledge. No one can fail to appreciate its apocalyptic vision. For that reason, it has also been plausibly interpreted as the Breaking of the Seventh Seal, as recounted in the Book of Revelations. Mad Meg is, indeed, reminiscent of the book of the Apocalypse	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Dulle Griet (Mad Meg)	Oil on wood, 117,4 x 162 cm	c. 1562	other	Netherlandish	1501-1550
12470-soldiers.jpg	During the second quarter of the 17th century a group of artists began to specialize in painting the life of soldiers. Scenes of plunder and battle were depicted but the ancient battle of sexes, where the field of action was a room in an inn or a barrack, and in which the outcome of the struggle is not much in doubt, was more frequently represented. Other popular subjects were soldiers drinking, smoking and gambling at cards or tric-trac, activities that contemporary predicants and moralists condemned as vices that endanger salvation. But it is doubtful if the painters of these scenes and their clients viewed them as pictorial reminders of the perils of sin and the inexorable need to lead a virtuous life. Pictures of the life of off-duty soldiers were called by the Dutch 'cortegaardjes' a corruption of the French term 'corps de garde'. The better ones show little movement or overt action. Painters of them had a special feeling for tonal values and their pictures take on a certain still-life quality. In their half-dark interiors the light glitters over uniforms, and a fine subdued play of colours, mostly broken and harmonized by delicate half-tones, betrays the Dutch gift for intimate pictorial qualities and a subtle rendering of textures. Some even anticipate the achievement of the high society painters of the following generation, when well-to-do burghers rather than soldiers and their friends became the favoured subject of genre painters. Specialists in this category worked in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Delft, but seldom in Haarlem. The leading ones in Amsterdam were Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde.What sets Duyster's rare pictures apart from those made by his contemporaries is his distinct chiaroscuro and the refinement of his colours. He was also better able than any of them to convey the fascinating visual drama which can take place  when people do little more than confront each other. It is difficult to think of a painter of his time who surpasses his penetrating characterization of the personalities of the men gathered round a fireplace in the modest nocturnal scene in the Soldiers beside a Fireplace in the Philadelphia museum. (Versions are also in the Hermitage, and in Düsseldorf.)  Duyster's approach is always original. His cortegaardjes and small pictures of dignified full-length single figures seen against dark backgrounds served as one of the points of departure for Terborch's great accomplishment in these branch of painting	DUYSTER, Willem Cornelisz.

42241-0309vela.jpg	Philip IV was a bold and enthusiastic huntsman, it was usual for the king to ride out with a small retinue in the extensive game preserves of the densely wooded Pardo. Emperor Charles V had built a watchtower on the way to the mountainous hunting grounds of the Sierra, as a place to stop and rest before the most strenuous stage of the journey. This tower was known as the Torre de la Parada, and Philip, who was particularly fond of it, extended it to make a comfortable hunting lodge. He was in haste to see it furnished, and commissioned Rubens to provide a large collection of new pictures on mythological subjects.After 1638, when the building itself was completed, it was the task of Velázquez to decide how they should be hung, and to contribute a series of hunting portraits himself, to hang with other appropriate works already in existence and with pictures by Dutch masters. This project cost him a great deal of time and trouble, but it also won him increasing appreciation at court.Velázquez's three extant hunting portraits (Philip IV as a Hunter, Prince Baltasar Carlos as a Hunter, and Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter) are life-size. Don Fernando, the king's younger brother, despite his spiritual calling, did not hesitate to indulge his passion for hunting. In this painting, showing him with his gun at the ready, he looks even more of a huntsman than his relations. His expressive outline balances the silhouette of the cinnamon-coloured dog sitting in front of him, a figure once again illustrating the court painter's skill in depicting animals. He pays them as much careful attention as he expends on human beings; while he is of course aware of the differences between animals and humans, he is also conscious of the dignity shared by all living creatures. The natural elegance of a horse's head or the body of a dog, their fiery or faithful natures - few painters have captured the beauty and individuality of animals as unforgettably as Velázquez	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter	Oil on canvas, 192 x 108 cm	1632-33	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

15601-12sasset.jpg	The painting, in which the head of the man and the hands of the figures are entirely overpainted, depicts Francesco Sassetti (1421-1490), general manager of the Medici bank, and (probably) his younger son Teodoro. Several portraits of Sassetti exist. However, the ruined condition of the present painting precludes comparison with the datable likenesses of Sassetti	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Francesco Sassetti and His Son Teodoro II	Tempera on wood, 76 x 53 cm	c. 1490	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
00656-lastsup.jpg	The Cenacolo of San Salvi is possibly the one which most easily lends itself to the transformation into a museum, with its fairly large interiors on the ground and first floors. It was part of a Vallombrosan convent and it passed to the Ladies of Faenza. In 1511 a contract was drawn up with Andrea del Sarto for the decoration of the Refectory. Although commissioned at the beginning of his career, it was carried out slowly and was completed between 1520-25, a particularly fine period of the work of Andrea del Sarto.Miraculously spared during the Siege of Florence in 1529-30, the fresco is placed under a large arch containing painted medallions with the Trinity and four Saints, protectors of the Vallombrosan Order. Andrea's personality and background are evident in the fresco's innovations; he appears to be influenced by Leonardo and the Roman work of Michelangelo and Raphael, revealed in a work of magnificence and pre-baroque spontaneity	ANDREA DEL SARTO	The Last Supper	Fresco, 525 x 871 cm	1520-25	religious	Italian	1501-1550
23499-vanitas3.jpg	Three very similar paintings attributed to the British-Dutch painter Simon Luttichuijs show a number of etchings and paintings of old people by or after Rembrandt and especially Jan Lievens. Two facing paintings resemble the old man and woman called Rembrandt's father and mother. However, the iconography of Luttichuijs's paintings, with their emphasis on mortality, the images seem merely to refer old age as such, not to specific individuals	LUTTICHUIJS, Simon	Still Life with a Skull	Oil on canvas	1635-40	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
03483-jerome1.jpg	In the second half of the fourteenth century, Augustinian nuns erected a church in the district of Cannareggio in Venice and dedicated the sacristy and a confraternity to St Jerome. They ambitiously decorated their headquarter with paintings depicting episodes from the life of the titular saint. Bastiani's contribution to the cycle consisted of two huge canvases, the Communion of St Jerome, and the Funeral of St Jerome.In the Communion of St Jerome, the saint is kneeling in his cell, as is confirmed by his bed, the open book, the crucifix, and the scourge. He is supported by his friend and disciple Eusebius and surrounded by the brethren. A pillar defines another scene. In the cloister of the monastery in Jerusalem, Jerome faces a person in eastern attire while he walks in the garden with another individual dressed in the Greek style, which may allude to his battle against heresy. The huge tree in the foreground is a symbol of salvation and life, while in the background, the hills, the battlements, and the well, although drawn from real life, are Marian symbols designed to inspire the devout to meditation and silent prayer. On the right, the quail represent the church, and the lion, the usual attribute of the saint, also belongs to St Mark and thus to the Venetian Republic	BASTIANI, Lazzaro	Communion of St Jerome	Oil on canvas, 191 x 240 cm	1470-72	religious	Italian	1451-1500
24098-6victory.jpg	The Madonna of Victory was commissioned by Francesco II Gonzaga To celebrate his victory over the French at Fornovo on 6 July 1495. On the first anniversary of the battle the altarpiece was installed with great ceremony over the high altar in the chapel of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Mantua.By the end of the 15th century, large single paintings  were being used as altarpieces, a form that reached its apogee in the works of Titian and Veronese. The stiffly hierarchical composition of the traditional Sacra Conversazione was also discarded.Mantegna's Mary is turning slightly away from the central axis, which runs from the Tree of Knowledge on the throne pedestal up through the Christ Child to the branch of coral hanging on a chain.

He used the studio early in the morning and in the late afternoon. When it became too hot, he would paint watercolours on the terrace, which was surrounded by bushes and small trees and had a magnificent view of the town of Aix.

44042-3john.jpg	The right panel depicts the Beheading of St John the Baptist.As a lascivious worldly beauty, Salome wears a magnificent dress in the fashion of French princesses, with exotic decorative items including the pointed head-dress. The background shows the scene of the banquet in which Salome's mother, Herodias, stabs the decapitated head of the Baptist in her hatred for him.The shallow zone of the foreground is set off by the strong effects of depth in the side panels, where the rooms are almost like tunnels. This makes the narrative backgrounds of the left and right panels subordinate. In the beheading of the Baptist, the body of the executed man is part of the foreground group, and the executioner can set his sword against John's right shoulder, shown in a flat plane. At the same time, however, two mourners who belong to the background are placed directly above the cellar stairs where the dead man is lying, and a figure diminished to about one-third of the size of the foreground figures appears to be standing only a little farther back from them.The side panels of the St John Altarpiece do not merely show the beginning and end of the Baptist's earthly life. The parallels between the pictorial motifs also express moral conflict. On the right, the unchaste Salome, in magnificent and seductive clothing, holds the Baptist's head. She and the executioner are turning away from each other and from their victim, as if painfully conscious of the crime that has been committed.Interestingly, however, the figure of Salome looks like a variant on the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation scene of the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the figure's knees are placed apart in an even more balletic position. Rogier was obviously able to make effective use of this elaborate and artificial pose in various circumstances, and only the worldly magnificence of Salome's dress and the context cause the viewer to assess it differently here. In addition, Salome's grave and melancholy face does not in fact differ much from the face of the Virgin Mary in that Annunciation, although in this later version it is leaning at rather too pronounced an angle to express grace. The artist has not set out simply to make the figure of Salome merely despicable; indeed, in the context of this scene, her noble features give her a touch of complex ambivalence	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	St John Altarpiece (right panel)	Oil on oak panel, 77 x 48 cm	1455-60	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

Its total height is 165 m, making it one of the tallest in Italy and the tallest man-made waterfall in Europe.

04903-venus_ad.jpg	The story of Venus and Adonis is taken from the tenth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Venus, the goddess of love, becomes enamoured of the beautiful young huntsman, Adonis. In Bol's painting Venus and the young Cupid try in vain to prevent Adonis from going hunting, as the goddess has had a premonition that the hunting party will have fatal consequences, and indeed the hunter is killed by a wild boar.The story of Venus and Adonis was a favourite in the Netherlands. Rubens painted the subject several times and Bol later painted another picture of the same theme. It was probably the moral component that made the story popular: Adonis was seen as the epitome of reckless youth, whose rejection of Venus' advice led him to his death	BOL, Ferdinand	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 168 x 230 cm	c. 1658	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

22606-9medici.jpg	"This painting was commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici. It is still in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence.Orphaned at a young age, Filippo Lippi was raised in the Carmelite convent of Santa Maria in Florence, where he would undoubtedly have seen Masaccio and Masolino at work on the frescoes in the Brancacci chapel. He took vows himself, but proved to be wholly unsuited to religious life. His name surfaces often in court documents. Tried for embezzlement (even tortured on the rack), he lived openly with a Carmelite nun, Lucretia Buti, who was his model and with whom he had a son -- painter Filippino  Lippi. His patron Cosimo de' Medici sheltered Filippo in ""protective custody"" at the Medici palace, hoping to prod him into finishing tardy commissions, but the artist escaped. He was eventually allowed to leave his order and marry Lucretia, but continued to wear a monk's habit and sign his works Fra (""brother"") Filippo.Filippo's Virgin is wistful and slightly melancholy, while the infant's heavy, almost muscular form recalls Masaccio's emphatically three-dimensional figures. Masaccio had used strongly directional light to reveal the form of his figures. Filippo's Virgin and child, on the other hand, are bathed in an overall glow that prevents the modeling of the figures from overpowering the graceful and well-defined line of his composition. As Filippo grew older his reliance on line increased and Masaccio's influence lessened"	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	Madonna and Child	Panel, 155 x 71 cm	-	religious	Italian	1401-1450
16469-3crucifi.jpg	This Crucifix  (now in the Museo Civico) was painted by Giotto for the Arena Chapel in Padua. It displays a striking similarity to the frescoed Crucifixion in the right transept of the Lower Church of San Francesco at Assisi.Represented on the recto is the Christus patiens, that is, with his eyes closed and in a state of abandon on the arms of the cross. On the extremities of the cross are: above, God the Father; on the left, the Virgin; on the right, St John; and on the foot of the cross, the skull symbolizing Golgotha	GIOTTO di Bondone	Crucifix (front)	Tempera on wood, 223 x 164 cm	1317	religious	Italian	1301-1350

35817-after_ra.jpg	Several members of the Ruysdael family of Haarlem figure in the history of Dutch painting, particularly landscape painting, the earliest of them, Salomon van Ruysdael, being inscribed in the Haarlem painters' guild in 1623. After the Rain, the earliest of the nine paintings by him in Budapest, contains a motif often repeated in his later paintings: a sandy road leading to a building half hidden by trees. Here and there we see breaks in the clouds which otherwise cover the sky, the air is still moist and misty after the storm, and the freshened foliage and the damp sand convey to perfection the characteristic atmosphere of the coastal countryside. In his early works, such as this, Salomon van Ruysdael used vivid greenish and yellowish colours, and it was only later that his colouring became darker and more muted.This painting is one of Ruysdael's finest early dune landscapes. It is based on a diagonal composition of a road leading from the right foreground into the left middle distance	RUYSDAEL, Salomon van	"Road in the Dunes with a Passenger Coach (""After the Rain"")"	Oil on oak panel, 56 x 86 cm	1631	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650

29315-repeta2.jpg	In 1701 the marquis Scipione Repeta engaged Vincenzan architect Francesco Muttoni to rebuild the old family palace located in Piazza San Lorenzo, Vicenza. The project was completed in 1711. The monumental double-flight staircase leading to the piano nobile was completed in 1707, according to the inscription above the arch next to the second landing. The ceiling of the staircase was frescoed by the French artist Louis Dorigny, who displayed a masterly skill in his use of perspective.At the top of the grand staircase, beneath a stucco cartouche that contains the representations Painting and Sculpture, Dorigny has painted a figure of Hercules as a bronze statue within an illusionistic niche	MUTTONI, Francesco	View of the grand staircase	Photo	1701-11	interior	Italian	1701-1750
33595-137portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 323A.The sitter of this painting was probably Lodewijk van Ludick (1607-1669), a shadowy non-artist in the Amsterdam art world. He was an associate of Rembrandt from 1653 on. They did deals in art, in real estate, in cash, in credit.

02770-tobias.jpg	The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight	ASSERETO, Gioachino	Tobias Healing the Blindness of His Father	Oil on canvas, 147 x 203 cm	-	religious	Italian	1601-1650
03374-praying.jpg	Marco Basaiti, an admirer of Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini found himself fascinated at the beginning of the sixteenth century by the new artistic manner pioneered by Giorgione. Already in 'Christ Praying in the Garden' which adorned the first altar on the right in the Church of San Giobbe and which belonged to the family of Francesco Foscari, the influence of the style of Antonello (visible in the integrity of colour of the figures and the arrangement of saints at the sides of the portico, of the apostles, and of Christ absorbed in prayer) gives way in the landscape to lyrically dreaming passages clearly drawing their spirit from Giorgione. Though this panel may not exactly offer a complete synthesis of the late fifteenth century world with the dazzling innovations of the early years of the sixteenth century, it is nevertheless emblematic of the meeting-point of two of the finest ages of Venetian painting.The doubt over the date derive from a faded inscription. The represented saints are Louis of Toulouse, Francis, Dominic, and Mark	BASAITI, Marco	Christ Praying in the Garden	Panel, 371 x 224 cm	1510 or 1516	religious	Italian	1501-1550
16056-legend.jpg	The decoration of the Upper Church was planned from the very beginning to conclude with the Legend of St Francis on the lower walls.The St. Francis cycle is usually dated after 1296 (Vasari records that the cycle was commissioned by Giovanni da Murro, who only became General of the Franciscans in 1296). However, according to some experts, the cycle was painted earlier.Scenes of the cycle:1. Homage of a Simple Man2. St Francis Giving his Mantle to a Poor Man3. Dream of the Palace4. Miracle of the Crucifix5. Renunciation of Wordly Goods6. Dream of Innocent III7. Confirmation of the Rule8. Vision of the Flaming Chariot9. Vision of the Thrones10.

13772-mary_mag.jpg	The image of this famous repentant sinner, prototype of the penitent in Christian art, became one of the favourite subjects of European art in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.In a career that spanned only thirteen years, Fetti's work underwent an astonishing evolution, from objective realism to lyricism, from compact form to the erosion of space, from solid and plastic modeling to a broken and agitated kind of painting, from descriptive to tortuous brush strokes, from dry to oily and liquid tints, from local colour to tonality, and from analytical concreteness to a sweetly sentimental air. Here the artist takes his inspiration from Correggio's Mary Magdalene reading. He represents the sensual and seductive heroine with half-closed eyes, lowered head, and the characteristic gesture of the hand on which she rests her head, with an intensely melancholic significance, equivalent to 'tristitia'. In fact the painter conceived this theme in terms of a Meditation or Melancholy.It is worth remembering that Giovan Battista Andreini's drama Maddalena was published in Mantua in 1617, and may have provided the idea for the painting. In any case, the last possible date for its execution is 1621, the date on which a copy (now at Hampton Court), possibly the work of the painter's sister Lucrina Fetti, was delivered to Ferdinando Gonzaga	FETTI, Domenico	The Repentant St Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 98 x 78,5 cm	1617-21	religious	Italian	1601-1650
05464-40pomegr.jpg	The picture's title is explained by the pomegranate in Mary's hand: this should be understood as symbolizing Christ's Passion, the wealth of seeds conveying the fullness of Christ's suffering. A comparison of this painting with Botticelli's earlier tondo Madonna del Magnificat reveals that the artist has now arranged the angels symmetrically, thereby avoiding the compositional difficulties of the older depiction.The Christ Child, whose hand is raised in blessing, is lying securely in the arms of Mary, but the sad, melancholy expression on the faces of mother and child are intended to remind the observer of the torments the Son of God will suffer in the future. The angels are worshipping Mary with lilies and garlands of roses. The Rosary is a prayer that was created in its present form in the 15th century, and rapidly became widespread. The beginning of this prayer is embroidered on the left angel s stola: AVE GRAZIA PLENA (Hail Mary, full of grace)	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Madonna of the Pomegranate (Madonna della Melagrana)	Tempera on panel, diameter 143,5 cm	c. 1487	religious	Italian	1451-1500

39704-06bravo.jpg	In the 17th century the painting was attributed to Giorgione, and later for a long time to Palma Vecchio. However, recently it was given to Tiziano.The Bravo, so called because of the mysterious armed man with his back to us, falls into Titian's Giorgionesque phase and demonstrates an undercurrent of cruelty. The subject has been convincingly identified as the arrest of Bacchus by Pentheus, King of Thebes, who opposed the Bacchic cult.

00642-portband.jpg	Laboratory examinations performed during the last restoration in 1986 have shown that this picture is a copy, albeit a very old and good one, of the portrait mentioned by Vasari in the first edition of his artists' biographies.

However, The Triumph of Silenus certainly seems to be stylistically consistent with this tentative oeuvre.

35147-lastsup.jpg	"The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the sixth compartment on the north wall. This scene is not so eventful as the other frescoes of the cycle, but the highlighted chalice standing on the table in front of Christ emphasizes the fact that we are seeing the institution of the sacrament of the Eucharist and, accordingly, a symbol of the New Covenant between God and mankind. There are three ""window"" paintings in the background, the Christ Praying on the Mount of Olives, the Arrest of Christ and the Crucifixion.

42817-4cather1.jpg	In this work, originally the altar-screen of the church of St Catherine, Veronesian colour reaches a peak of richness and splendour. Along the diagonal of the composition which terminates in the drapes billowing around the columns, new chromatic notes are struck; the 'fortissimo' of the steps and figures in the foreground harmonizes with the 'pianissimo' of angels and cherubs which emerge from the grey-gold clouds of the celestial kingdom in the background. Linking the two planes of colour are two cherubs holding the martyr's palm and the heavenly crown above the Virgin and St Catherine while the angel below lifts her head and holds out her arms to receive the sign and the reward of martyrdom. All three are portrayed with Apollonian purity against the intense blue of the sky, an unforgettable example of Veronese's exquisite use of colour. Even more appropriate is the 17th century comment by Marco Boschini: 'It is almost as if the painter to create his effects used gold, pearls and rubies, emeralds sapphires and purest, most perfect diamonds'.Here too, as in his pictures of religious feasts, Veronese successfully combines the religious subject with social pomp and ceremony, transforming the sacred event into a luxurious sixteenth-century festival. He achieves this in part by changing the setting of the episode, which no longer takes place in Alexandria but in a typically Venetian location	VERONESE, Paolo	Mystical Marriage of St Catherine	Oil on canvas, 337 x 241 cm	c. 1575	religious	Italian	1551-1600
18710-1ospeda2.jpg	"The decoration of the Music Room is divided into two parts, one dedicated to the world of allegories, the other to the real world. Apollo, the god of music, dominates the fresco on the back wall of the Room, which is splendidly laid out by Agostino Mengozzi Colonna in a manner that recalls the scheme employed by the elder Mengozzi Colonna to frame Tiepolo's The Banquet of Cleopatra in the Palazzo Labia. Apollo personally directs the orchestra of young girls (the ""putte"") seated in his right. Next to him, dressed in yellow, Pasquale Anfossi (1727-1797), the opera composer who was then in charge of the Ospedaletto, conducts the chorus, holding a rolled-up musical score"	GUARANA, Jacopo	Apollo Conducting the Orchestra of Putte	Fresco	1776	mythological	Italian	1751-1800

33574-103portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 391.The sitter's name and age are inscribed on the canvas in a later hand, 'Catrina Hooghsaet/Out 50 Jaer' (ie. 50 years old). Catharina (Catrina) Hooghsaet (1607-1685) was the wife of a dyer, Hendrick Jacobsz. Rooleeuw, and Rembrandt may have painted his portrait too, although, if so, all trace of it has been lost. The couple were Mennonites, a flourishing Protestant sect to which Rembrandt also intermittently belonged. Among the restrictions the Mennonites, followers of the sixteenth-century Dutch divine, Menno Simons, imposed on themselves were a refusal to bear arms or hold public office. The sect was popular with artists and craftsmen, as by joining it they were able to escape the control exercised by the clergy over the lives of orthodox Calvinist citizens.To judge from Catrina's clothes, which are relatively plain but of good quality, her husband was successful in his business. (The bleaching and dyeing of cloth were important Dutch industries.) The pair probably did not belong to the highest social class but Catrina acts almost as if she did. She sits confidently in her chair in a way that is both relaxed and animated, and a quizzical smile plays over her features. The handkerchief she holds in her hand supplies a touch of informality, as does the parrot perched on a ring hanging from the ceiling. Altogether this is a wonderful portrait, vigorous, crisp and surprisingly clear in lighting for its date	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Portrait of Catharina Hooghsaet	Oil on canvas, 126 x 98 cm	1657	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
21934-8jerome.jpg	In about 370, St Jerome, later a Father of the Church, is said to have withdrawn to live as a hermit in the desert of Chalcis near Antioch, in order to produce a translation of the Bible and live as an ascetic. Leonardo depicts the Father of the Church as a penitent, not a scholar. St Jerome is kneeling in a humble posture that arouses our sympathy, in front of the sketched cross of Christ on the right, and before him lies the lion, his attribute. In his right hand he is holding a stone with which he is striking his breast.

41183-zhairy2.jpg	"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome.

10263-02cuspi1.jpg	Johannes Spiessheimer (Cuspinian) was a scholar in the court of the Emperor Maximilian I, himself a writer, who made Vienna, through its chancellery and university, the leading humanist city in Germany. Cranach painted the double portrait of the Viennese humanist Dr. Cuspinian and his wife Anna, daughter of an official of the Emperor on the occasion of their marriage. Cranach composed these portraits as a pair. This is apparent in the continuity of the landscape behind the elegantly dressed couple. The trees at the edges of the painting, on the left and right of the figures, are placed so that their branches form an arch, imparting an air of grandeur to the sitters.The background was evidently composed with a distinct purpose in mind: nothing here is arbitrary. The landscape is full of erudite symbolism, probably devised by Cuspinian himself. The various images disguise hieroglyphic allusions to the cabbala. However, it would be quite unsatisfactory merely to decipher the landscape background symbol by symbol without seeing its significance as a whole. Beyond a system of occult signs, the landscape allows a generous framework for the couple's understanding of themselves, providing a medium for the new cult of sensitivity and awareness of nature which some humanists were propagating in literary form through the Classical topos of the pleasance, or pleasure-park	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Portrait of Dr. Johannes Cuspinian	Oil on wood, 59 x 45 cm	c. 1502	portrait	German	1501-1550
14696-01conver.jpg	This charming picture belongs to Gainsborough's early period, when he was working in London and Suffolk. The theme of the conversation in a park evokes Watteau and his school; it denotes a French influence, which played a considerable part in the formation of the artist - he was in fact a pupil of the French engraver Gravelot at the St Martins Lane Academy. This picture has been thought to represent Thomas Sandby and his wife. At the Watson sale in 1832, it was described as depicting the artist and his wife. The painter's marriage took place in 1746; a very similar work, Mr and Mrs Andrews, is dated 1748.The open-air portrait is a familiar theme in the English school, whereas in eighteenth-century France the portrait is usually in an interior. The evocation of nature by the English portrait painters is on the whole conventional; it is quite another matter with Gainsborough, however, who has treated the landscape for its own sake	GAINSBOROUGH, Thomas	Conversation in a Park	Oil on canvas, 73 x 68 cm	c. 1740	genre	English	1751-1800

11111-early02.jpg	Beside portraiture, Degas's early work was also centred on historical themes drawn from religious tradition or mythology. Between 1860 and 1865 he painted five historical paintings, for which there are several sketches and versions: Young Spartans Exercising, Semiramis Founding a City, Alexander and Bucephalus, Jephthah's Daughter, and The Sufferings of the City of New Orleans, the latter being his first entry at the Salon.These paintings are very original and unlike any historical painting in the nineteenth century. They conformed to the rules of classicist composition, but they were also  innovative because of the freshness of his figures and the warm colours of his landscapes.The Young Spartans Exercising was reworked several times, and numerous related drawings and studies survive	DEGAS, Edgar	Young Spartans Exercising	Oil on canvas, 109 x 155 cm	c. 1860	historical	French	1851-1900

23942-miracl6.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezières, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them.The subject of this 'telero' is the miraculous healing in 1414 of the little daughter of Benvegnudo. Having been paralysed ever since birth, she gained the use of her limbs after touching the three candles which her father had placed on the relic of the Holy Cross.

28888-grassi1.jpg	"The Palazzo Grassi, overlooking the Grand Canal opposite the Ca' Rezzonico in Venice. was built for the Grassi family by Giorgio Massari between 1749 and 1766. The architect adopted an innovative solution on the ground floor, with its two-story high main hall, large colonnaded courtyard, and ""imperial style' main staircase, which proceed with grand theatrical effect from the Grand Canal façade through to the back of the building.For the decoration of the first staircase landing, Massari turned to his trusted sculptor, Giovan Maria Morlaiter, who is responsible for the large bas-relief that depicts Concord. It was the celebrated sculptor, who suggested his own son, Michelangelo, to execute the frescoes on the second landing. The architecture was painted by Francesco Zanchi (active 1734-1772).Morlaiter's decoration develops along the walls of the staircase space, at the level of the second landing. Inside seven large arches delimited by Ionic pilasters, he painted a large faux loggia, closed off at the back by a marble wall, against which statues of goddesses stand inside aedicules surmounted by rectangular tympanums. A carnival-like reception is under way on the loggia, and the participants include a number of elegant ladies and noblemen, some in wigs, some in three-cornered hats, as well as a prelate and an Eastern figure, all busy conversing amiably, or sipping coffee and liquors served by efficient waiters in livery.In spite of the fact that Morlaiter's authorship is well documented, in the nineteenth century the frescoes were attributed to several painters, among them Pietro Longhi"	MORLAITER, Michelangelo	Decoration of the grand staircase	Fresco	c. 1766	interior	Italian	1751-1800
10706-cloud_sx.jpg	"After working as a decorative painter in his home town of Bergen, Norway, Dahl studied landscape painting at the Copenhagen Academy from 1811 to 1818. Here he was impressed by the work of Jens Juel and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, but the crucial influence came with a study of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters of landscape. One of them, Allaert Everdingen, had visited Norway and subsequently developed a type of ""Nordic landscape"" based on his impressions. This style was later taken up by the Norwegian national movement in the nineteenth century. Alongside the ""Italian landscape,"" the ""Nordic landscape"" also became established on the Continent early in the century.Stimulated by his first extensive travels through Norway in 1826, Dahl supplemented his previous range of motifs - waterfalls, moving clouds, and windswept trees - with depictions of the bare plateaus of the high mountain regions and their cloud formations, becoming an innovator in Norwegian as well as German landscape painting. In 1818, he settled at Dresden, where he associated with Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus. In 1824, like Friedrich, he was appointed professor at the Dresden Academy. Dresden and its environs began to feature frequently in his compositions, in which the sky often occupied the larger part of the canvas"	DAHL, Johan Christian Clausen	Cloud Study with Horizon	Oil on board, 25 x 28 cm	1832	landscape	Norwegian	1801-1850
37306-foglian1.jpg	"The fresco of Guidoriccio da Fogliano, depicting the conquest of the castles of Montemassi and Sassoforte in 1328, formed part of a fresco cycle ""Castelli"" which occupied the upper part of the wall opposite to the Maest&#224; in the Sala del Mappamondo. The cycle, commemorating the castles conquered by the Sienese, was initiated in 1314 by the representation of the Castle of Giuncarico, it was continued by the Guidoriccio and in 1331 by the Castles of Arcidosso and Piano. The latter were destroyed in 1361 when Lippo Vanni painted the Battles of Valdichiana and Poggio Imperiale. In the 1970s, the famous fresco, which had always been, considered the greatest example of Martini's artistic excellence, was re-attributed to a much later artist. The controversy that followed this re-attribution, further stimulated by the discovery of a fresco below the Guidoriccio (a very beautiful one, and certainly much older as we can see from the overlapping of the intonaco), turned into an animated diatribe that has not yet been placated"	SIMONE MARTINI	Equestrian Portrait of Guidoriccio da Fogliano	Fresco	c. 1330	portrait	Italian	1301-1350

42536-ruthnaom.jpg	The biblical story depicted here is the following. Ruth was a Moabite woman and great-grandmother of David. The very human and sympathetic study of her in the book of Ruth relates how she was married to a Hebrew immigrant in Moab and after his death left her native land and went with her mother-in-law Naomi, to Bethlehem. Here she was allowed to glean the corn in the fields belonging to Boaz, a rich farmer and kinsman of Naomi. Ruth, true to her nature, maintained, on Naomi's advice, a modest demeanour among the young men working at the harvest. One night she went and lay at the feet of Boaz as he slept in the field. By this act Boaz saw her virtue and later decided to assume the responsibilities toward her of a kinsman.

These aspects are already evident in the present work, in which as much attention is devoted to the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments as to the prophet.

Formerly, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, it was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The soft modeling of the figures in this panel is typical of Bicci's style. The painting is in very good condition and allows us to appreciate the care taken to describe the delicate folds of the red mantle, the gold highlights at the edges of the robes, the raised inscriptions in the halos and the fine decoration of both the damask cloth on the floor and the sheet that wraps the Christ Child. This interest in the intricate adornment of the fabrics, in particular, points to Gentile's influence on Bicci	BICCI DI LORENZO	Madonna and Child with Saints Matthew and Francis	Tempera on panel, 83 x 48 cm	1430s	religious	Italian	1401-1450
23740-andorfe2.jpg	The sitter of the portrait is Sebastian Andorfer (1469-1537), a top mining official of Schwaz in Tirol. His father held a prominent position in the mining administration at Schwaz, serving as 'Silberbrenner' (refiner of silver) from 1470 to 1499. Sebastian assumed the post in 1499 and occupied it until his death in 1537.A variant of the portrait exists, also dated 1517, in which Andorfer is depicted bearded. The two portraits may exemplify the practice, which can be observed in contemporary medals, of recording a change in appearance for eternity. However, no known biographical events correspond with the 1517 date of the portraits. Furthermore, technical investigations suggest that the execution of the beardless portrait preceded the bearded one.The two Andorfer portraits stand as the earliest securely dated works in Maler's oeuvre	MALER, Hans	Sebastian Andorfer	Oil on panel, 43 x 36 cm	1517	portrait	German	1501-1550
33423-66newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 615.In 1661, Rembrandt painted a small group of half-length figures of apostles, each with a strongly individualized character. At present only four seem to be definitely from his hand, though others have been attributed to him. One of the four is this St Bartholomew and another, slightly distinct from the rest because Rembrandt used himself as the model, is St Paul.St Bartholomew holds his traditional attribute, the knife with which he was flayed to death. It is, of course, no more than a formal means of identifying him and as such was a common device in art. Apart from the knife, there is nothing in Rembrandt's painting to indicate that the figure is a saint; not even his clothes are obviously antique, and he grasps the knife as if he were about to cut something with it. Moreover, there is the curious accident that his short hair, parted almost in the middle, and his wide moustache give him the look of a man of the late nineteenth century	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	St Bartholomew	Oil on canvas, 88 x 75 cm	1661	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

40766-09icon.jpg	Every day of the Church year is dedicated to the memory of one or more saints or to a feast which commemorates an important event in the life of Christ or His mother. While it is fairly common to find depictions of all the saints and feasts commemorated in a particular month, it is rare to see the whole Church year painted on one or two panels. The picture shows an old Russian example of a complete calendar in the form of a diptych.The Orthodox liturgical year comprises two cycles of festivals: one of movable feasts based on the lunar calendar, and another, whose dates are fixed, based on the solar year. The saints and feasts of the latter are depicted in ten rows on each panel, in precise chronological order.

10951-trompe.jpg	The work of Gerard David, another foreigner drawn to the wealthy city of Bruges, offers a final summary of the technical and spiritual tradition of the fifteenth century. David was born in Oudewater in Holland, but worked mostly in Bruges between 1484 and 1523, where, in a manner of speaking, he became Memling's successor. Two of his masterpieces, The Judgment of Cambyses (1498) and the Triptych of Jan des Trompes, belong to the Groeninge Museum in Bruges. In both works, Memling's flawless precision and cool smoothness are combined with the anatomical realism and seriousness of Van der Goes.The triptych with the Baptism of Christ, even though it was probably done after the Judgment of Cambyses, still breathes the quiet, ethereal atmosphere so characteristic of the Flemish Primitives. It is also one of the period's most remarkable artistic evocations of landscape and flora. It was commissioned by Jan des Trompes, a leading civil servant in Bruges, who appears in the painting with his first and second wives (front and rear of the right wing). His third wife donated it to the Chapel of the Vierschaar tribunal in Saint Basil's Church after his death	DAVID, Gerard	Triptych of Jan Des Trompes	Oil on wood, 129,7 x 96,6 cm (central panel), 132 x 43 cm (each wings)	1505	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

32825-37entom4.jpg	"Three compositions, executed in a delicate monochrome and showing the Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity), combine to form the predella of an altarpiece that Atalanta Baglioni commissioned from Raphael, possibly toward the middle of the year 1506, for the family chapel in the church of S. Francesco al Prato in Perugia. The noblewoman intended the work to commemorate her son, Grifonetto, who had been assassinated in July 1500 during the struggles between rival branches of her family to establish control over Perugia.The altarpiece was originally composed of a large central panel showing the Deposition of Christ (now in the Borghese Gallery, Rome), a pinnacle with God the Father, Blessing between Angels (painted by a pupil, now in the National Gallery of Umbria, Perugia), and the predella. Both the main panel and the predella were carried from Perugia to Rome by Pope Paul V. They were replaced by copies in 1608.Charity, which dominates the predella from its central position, is the most complex of the three predella figures. The tondo with the personification of the virtue has clearly been influenced by Michelangelo's Pitti Madonna; on one side a putto holds a flaming torch on its shoulders, while on the other a putto tips coins out of a bowl. Hope, forming the right-hand section of the predella, has at its centre the allegorical figure. On either side are putti in confident attitudes. Faith, traditionally identified by the chalice and host, is flanked by two small angels holding plaques with the Greek inscriptions ""CPX"" and ""IHS,"" alluding to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist."

02514-1vertum.jpg	There is no mistaking this masterpiece of fantasy and virtuoso imagination by Arcimboldo. The mythical Vertumnus (or Vortumnus), god of harvests and abundance, is in fact a bizarre portrait of the Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II. In the sixteenth century the emperor's cosmopolitan court in Prague became a centre of international art, where Arcimboldo moved in the refined and exclusive circles of late European Mannerism. His painting might appear almost irreverent, but in fact is the manifestation of his eager search for new ideas and his exploration of different ways of expression. (It also gives quite a good impression of the Emperor.) This led him to break the usual rules in order to provoke uncensored reactions and emotions. The paintings and objects contained in Rudolf of Habsburg's Wunderkammer (room of wonders) were unfortunately scattered after a Swedish army sacked Prague during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48)	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Vertumnus	Oil on panel, 68 x 56 cm	c. 1590	mythological	Italian	1551-1600

04682-paulvirg.jpg	Bernardin de St. Pierre's Paul et Virginie (first published in 1788) became an immediate bestseller and continued inspiring songs, poems, plays, ballets, operas, and pictures well into the nineteenth century. It is the sentimental story of two children of French parentage growing up on a tropical island, the &#206;le de France (Mauritius), their love, separation, and untimely deaths. It appealed to the same readership that enjoyed historical romances and troubadour themes.This painting is unusual in the context of literary paintings for the large proportion of canvas given over to landscape rather than figures.

06337-01games.jpg	"The painting is referred to as the ""encyclopaedia of Flemish children's games"". It represents about 84 games some of them are practiced until present days. There is also an assumption that the painting is part of a four-piece cycle representing either the Four Seasons or the Ages of Man. If that was Bruegel's intention, it is unlikely that the series progressed beyond this painting, for there are no contemporary or subsequent mentions of related pictures.Bruegel has portrayed over 250 children on this panel. They are playing with pieces of wood, with bones, with hoops and barrels - specially crafted toys were rare in the 16th century. Their faces often appear ageless: perhaps the painter wished to warn the observer against frittering away his life as if it were a childlike game. The children, who range in age from toddlers to adolescents, roll hoops, walk on stilts, spin tops, ride hobby-horses, stage mock tournaments, play leap-frog and blind man's buff, perform handstands, inflate pigs' bladders and play with dolls and other toys. They have also taken over the large building that dominates the square: it may be a town hall or some other important civic building, in this way emphasizing the moral that the adults who direct civic affairs are as children in the sight of God. This crowded scene is to some extent relieved by the landscape in the top left-hand corner; but even here children are bathing in the river and playing on its banks.In addition to the games in the left part of the background a typical Flemish landscape, while on the right a street with excellent perspective can be seen"	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Children's Games	Oil on wood, 118 x 161 cm	1559-60	genre	Netherlandish	1501-1550

Elizabeth's sister Sarah married Ploos van Amstel's brother. and George van der Mijn was a close friend of his patron who had contact with the foremost artists, collectors, and intellectuals of the city.Van der Mijn portrait of Elizabeth Troost holding a small cup is as sympathetic as a Chardin lady.

In the centre, a maenad and a satyr dance and to the right other satyrs drink and putti play music. Most striking among the revellers is the urinating child; Lauri may have been inspired by the presence of a similar putti in Titian's early masterpiece, the Bacchanal of the Andrians.

17564-22portra.jpg	This well preserved painting represents the peak of Gossart's portraiture. In terms of its ambitious composition and the mastery illusion inn depicting such a wide variety of objects, it is unparalleled in his oeuvre. It joins a group of occupational portraits that had begun to appear by the middle of the fifteenth century, with examples such as St Eligius in His Workshop by Petrus Christus, and became increasingly popular in the early sixteenth century with paintings by Bernaert van Orley, Quentin Massys, Maerten van Heemskerck, Hans Holbein, and Marinus van Reymerswaele.The sitter of the present painting has been identified by the objects on his desk as either a banker or a merchant. According to a recent research, he is Jan Jacobsz. Snoeck (1510-1585), a descendant of a noble family of Gorinchem, who held important posts, including alderman, in his town	GOSSART, Jan	Portrait of a Man	Oil on oak panel, 64 x 48 cm	c. 1530	portrait	Flemish	1501-1550
31985-1deposi.jpg	The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself. Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms	PONTORMO, Jacopo	Deposition	Oil on wood, 313 x 192 cm	c. 1528	religious	Italian	1501-1550
29636-adormag.jpg	Willem van Nieulandt the Younger studied in Rome in 1602-03. Later he produced some 115 engravings of Italian subjects, predominantly of classical ruins in Rome, based on drawings he made there. His antiquarian interest is manifest in the present picture. The subject is set before an array of Roman structures, including to the left the Pyramid of Caius Cestius, and to its right is Trajan's Column. In the foreground lies a substantial Corinthian capital.The figure in a green cloak and makeshift turban in the right foreground is most likely a self-portrait	NIEULANDT, Willem van, the Younger	Adoration of the Magi	Oil on oak panel, 68 x 107 cm	1620s	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

40127-poggio.jpg	Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561. The property came into the possession of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The picture shows the ceiling painting in one of the rooms in the south suite of the Villa Poggio Imperiale. It depicts the Peace Offering of Emperor Augustus. It was painted by Giuliano Traballesi and the architecture painter Giuseppe del Moro.Costumed as pontifex maximus, Augustus is placing an offering on an altar, surrounded by other priests and military officers with their standards. In the foreground lie a bound captive, a sacrificial lamb, and a sacrificial bull. Looming in the background is a temple whose columns are wound with garlands, probably the Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed once peace was declared.Images showing the decorations of the various rooms in the Villa Poggio Imperiale can be viewd on the respective pages of Tommaso Gherardini, Giuliano Traballesi, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Maria Terreni, and Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini	TRABALLESI, Giuliano	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	1769-70	mythological	Italian	1751-1800
39123-minuet.jpg	This is an extremely interesting early piece which borrows its compositional layout from scenes painted by his father. The difference is that Giandomenico chose not to paint mythological or allegorical scenes. The minuet is being danced by people wearing traditional masks and having a good time.

20076-12freder.jpg	Because painters, with some famous exceptions, were considered craftsmen on the level of carpenters or masons, it was not normal for a prince in Holland to deal with them directly. However, Gerrit van Honthorst was able to work for all the courts and for several foreign ones as well. One advantage he had is that he was hired to paint portraits of the royals, giving them quality time with princes and princesses and a chance to charm them.The pair of this painting, depicting Amalia van Solms, wife of Stadholder Frederik Hendrik (now in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris) was painted by Rembrandt	HONTHORST, Gerrit van	Stadholder Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange	Oil on canvas, 77 x 61 cm	1631	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

07160-canal201.jpg	"This is one of the four paintings ordered in 1725 from Canaletto by Stefano Conti, a textile merchant and collector from Lucca. Canaletto described the first painting, saying that it showed ""the Rialto Bridge from the side facing the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, across from the buildings where the magistrates of, for instance, the Camerlenghi work. These buildings border the market where all sorts of fruits and vegetables are unloaded for distribution to shops all over the city. Painted in the middle of the canal is a distinguished-looking sloop with figures in it being rowed swiftly across the water and, nearby, another gondola being rowed by the liveried servants of the imperial ambassador.""In these canvases Canaletto was apparently striving for the greatest verisimilitude, in which he succeeded by virtue of his great ingenuity and artistic sensibility. The curvature of the river is beautifully rendered in an arc flowing from the approaching sloop, under the dark bridge and on to the sunlit area beyond. This movement is effected by the curving roofline on the left and by the gondolas crossing the canal in the foreground, which binds the composition horizontally. As in so many other cases Canaletto was not the first to represent this particular cityscape; there is an early eighteenth-century print of the same subject by Filippo Vasconi which, in turn, is based on an etching by Israel Silvestre from the mid-seventeenth century.Here, too, Canaletto must have planned his composition with the help of two, now lost, preparatory drawings covering an angle of approximately ninety degrees. The compositional sketch (c. 1725, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) for the painting has survived and in it we can see how the master combined the two views, creating an effect similar to that of a photograph produced by a wide-angle lens"	CANALETTO	The Grand Canal near the Ponte di Rialto	Oil on canvas, 90,5 x 134,6 cm	1725	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

26634-01_1pr2c.jpg	The picture shows the two pairs of putti next to the throne of Joel. Simulating stone reliefs, the putti appear to support the projection of the cornice.

23996-8cardina.jpg	Mantegna painted monumental likenesses that combine the particularity of Eyckian physiognomy with the authority of ancient Roman busts.

26163-0546nati.jpg	The composition is a large-scale variant of the left wing of the Floreins triptych. So detailed are the figures in their execution and so precisely do the architecture and the landscape match Memling's style that an unknown work by the master must lie at its basis. After all, it is difficult to believe that a follower would be capable of producing such a penetrating, complex and monumental variant in the master's pure style of an existing small composition. The general pictorial treatment is harder and more contrasting than we are accustomed to in autograph works, and leans more towards the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. If it is indeed by that master, then it is his technically most accomplished work. It might also be based on a design provided by Memling which was executed by another painter (in his workshop?). The painting would appear at any rate to date from the final quarter of the fifteenth century. It was unknown until relatively recently.

15516-shepher.jpg	"""He painted in tempera, as a companion to this work, a Nativity of Christ which must excite the wonder of every thinking man, introducing his own portrait and some heads of shepherds, which are considered divine"" (Vasari).The Sassetti Chapel is consecrated to the birth of Christ, and as a result much in the chapel is conceived with that event in mind. The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: ""This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.""The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit. [While Fulvi(us), augur of Pompey, was falling by the sword in Jerusalem he said: the urn that covers (conceals) me shall bring forth a god]. This is an ancient prophecy by Fulvius. The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. In his Adoration of the Shepherds, Ghirlandaio combines this reference to the Roman classical age with knowledge of Flemish art and turns them into an integrated whole.An historic event that took place a few years before this work was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work. An altarpiece ordered by Tommaso Portinari from Hugo van der Goes in Bruges reached Florence in May 1483. Florentine artists saw van der Goes' Adoration of the Shepherds as a shining comet showing new ways of painting. In Ghirlandaio's altarpiece, the shepherds pushing their way into the picture from the right, with their harsh, life-like features, are drawn directly from this Flemish model. Ghirlandaio's landscape in the background also displays features from north of the Alps"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Adoration of the Shepherds	Panel, 167 x 167 cm	1483-85	religious	Italian	1451-1500

05118-st_peter.jpg	"In 1377 Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome and the magnificent palace of Avignon became only the residence of antipopes. The popes' ""captivity in Babylon"" had terminated, but Avignon continued to act as a channel through which Italian Gothic art gradually penetrated further and further into the rest of Europe. It was in Avignon that Luis Borrassá first came into contact with 'court' Gothic, in the period around 1400, when this style was widely adopted in numbers of countries; it became in fact an international style founded upon all that Borrassá has learned from the brothers Serra.The painting in the church of Santa Maria in Terrasa illustrates the text from St. Matthew: 'And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And he saith unto them: Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him' (4, 19-20). This scene is connected with another one from the Gospel: 'Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship... the ship was now in the midst of the sea... Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled... And Peter said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' (Matthew 15, 22-31). Christ's face and his gesture are very beautiful, but the figures of both Christ and the two disciples are still stereotyped, differing in size in the traditional manner of early religious paintings: on the other hand, his treatment of the fishermen, particularly the one who is rowing, testifies to his own acute observation and his ability to make use of it.This altarpiece manifests a mixture of archaic technique and new characteristics of the International Gothic. The colour technique is Byzantine, but the shortening of the boats, the less sized figures in the background give some feeling of the perspective."

42322-1011vela.jpg	The young prince was a sickly child from birth, and he died at the age of four. He appears in this picture in a pink dress trimmed with silver, with a translucent pinafore over it, and bearing some striking accessories: various amulets were supposed to protect him against the evil eye, and an amber apple was thought to ward off infections. The bloodless face of the blue-eyed prince looks even paler due to the contrast with the silver highlights in his straw-coloured fair hair. Pale daylight falls in through the open door in the background. Otherwise, the room is full of shadows that seem to threaten the little figure. Palomino considered this portrait one of the finest ever painted by Velázquez, and singled out the little dog on the chair for special praise	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Infante Felipe Próspero	Oil on canvas, 128,5 x 99,5 cm	c. 1660	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

04471-martha.jpg	Joachim Beuckelaer, the nephew and pupil of Pieter Aertsen, specialised in market scenes and genre paintings. Following the path opened up by his uncle, he responded to the growing demand of a prosperous bourgeoisie that wished to decorate their houses with works that reflected the lay character of their surroundings, whilst retaining a moral and religious significance.Jesus' visit to the house of Martha and Mary, taken from St Luke's Gospel, formed the basis of several representations from the mid-16th century onwards. In the religious context of the time, this scene illustrated one of the fundamental differences opposing Catholics and Protestants. The latter sought salvation in action whilst the former placed greater value on the contemplative life. Here the artist relegates the teaching of the divine word to the back of the painting, devoting the entire foreground to active life, incarnated by Martha, and in so doing juxtaposing a genre scene and a still-life. Like Aertsen, he assembles the domestic scene in his studio, drawing from a repertory of standard objects and utensils that he was to constantly reproduce elsewhere in various combinations. Again like Aertsen, he has borrowed from Serlio's treatise the Renaissance architecture in which he places his composition.However, it would be unfair to dismiss Beuckelaer as a mere follower. Rather the artist stands out by his extraordinary ability to reproduce textures in their full sensuousness, using a light and subtle stroke and a delicately gradated palette. With considerable virtuosity and delight he precisely depicts the varnished terracotta of the crocks, the flaccid skin of the plucked fowl, the starched but still supple serviettes, and the fragility of the hair drawn back over the kitchen-maid's temples. The soft greasiness of the meat or the velvety softness of the mallard duck are set against the flat glint of the tin pot and the glazed transparency of the cabochon glasses or berkemeier. A search for harmony guides him in the distribution of objects, colours, light and shade, in a careful composition that leaves nothing to chance.Multiplying the different levels of interpretation, the image moves beyond a simple illustration of the Gospel story to become a philosophical exegesis of visible reality. Invested with moral and symbolic content, each object reminds man of his carnal nature and warns him against the dangers of voluptuousness	BEUCKELAER, Joachim	Christ in the House of Martha and Mary	Oil on oak, 113 x 163 cm	1565	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
00965-05humili.jpg	In this painting, the image of Mary recalls the ideal of beauty promoted in International Gothic art, although her pose and shape give her a three-dimensionality and solidity closer to the art of Masaccio. The Virgin is placed, following the traditional iconography of the Virgin of Humility, on a cushion rather than a throne.The painting is notable for its brilliant and luminous palette, in which reds, blues and golds are harmoniously combined. Also outstanding is the sweetness and spirituality of the faces of the figures, whose poses and gestures are depicted with great naturalism	ANGELICO, Fra	The Virgin of Humility	Tempera on panel, 99 x 49 cm	1435-45	religious	Italian	1401-1450
18330-1304grec.jpg	This painting was made for the Capilla de San José (Chapel of Saint Joseph) in Toledo, originally it was placed on the left-hand side of the high altar. The paintings for the high altar (still in place) were the Saint Joseph and the Christ Child, and above, the Coronation of the Virgin; and, for the side altars, the Saint Martin and the Beggar and the Virgin and Child with Saints were placed.Clad in gold damascened armour with a ruff typical of fashionable Toledan dress in El Greco's day, St Martin is shown astride a white horse as he prepares to cut his bright green cloak in half in order to share it with the beggar who stands on the left. Below, a distant and freely painted view of Toledo shows the Alcántara bridge and the river Tagus. The gleaming whiteness of the horse and the shining gold-damascene work on Martin's armour contrast with the darkening sky behind.The painting is from the Widener Collection.

24208-oarsmen.jpg	Although officially considered a third member of the so-called German Romanists, Hans von Marées, long resident in Italy, moved far from the dramatic narrative of Böcklin or the ponderous perspective of Feuerbach. The Berlin-trained von Marées was Germany's major prophet of Modernism, filling a critical role as that nation's Puvis de Chavannes, the French master who was thirteen years his senior. Like Puvis de Chavannes, von Marées followed the Nazarene and Pre-Raphalite revival of wall painting.

33589-131portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 416.Rembrandt's colouristic power increases tremendously during his last period, although not all of his mature works display it; some of the single portraits remain largely monochromatic. The so-called Jewish Bride of c. 1665, which may be a commissioned portrait of a couple in the guise of a biblical pair (such as Isaac and Rebecca), belongs to his most brilliant colouristic creations. Even in reproductions it is possible to see something of the fluctuating quality of his late paint, the vibrations of the tones, and the harmonious fusion of the whole; but they can hardly suggest the warmth of the fiery scarlets, the golden yellows, the delicate blues and olives, the powerful whites, and deep blacks of his late palette. The broad, calm, relief-like arrangement of the life-size half-figures recalls a certain type of Venetian Renaissance painting. This reveals a touch of classical taste, but the use of colour in the portrait is quite unclassical.Like The Night Watch, this is another misnamed masterpiece by Rembrandt which it would be insensitive to re-title. To be sure, the painting does not represent a Jewish bridal couple in the sense which the nineteenth century, which invented the title, would have had in mind. The picture would then have been regarded as a romantic costume-piece, its very strangeness and aura of secretiveness suggesting that it showed some exotic rite, which was outside the experience of a predominantly Christian society.There can be no doubt, however, that an intimate relationship between the two figures was intended by the artist. The man places his hand on the woman's breast, while she moves instinctively to protect her modesty, in the classic pose of the Venus pudica which Rembrandt would have known from engravings or casts of classical statues. Yet the couple show every sign of tenderness towards each other, so this is not a common seduction scene (a frequent enough subject in Dutch painting). The theme most widely favoured by modern scholars is Isaac embracing his wife Rebecca while they were being spied on by Abimelech (Genesis, Chapter XXVI), which Rembrandt had previously represented in a drawing. To summarize the Bible narrative, Isaac, staying in the land of the Philistines, passes off Rebecca as his sister, because, if the Philistines had wanted to seduce her and had known she was Isaac's wife, they would have felt obliged to kill him first. One day, Abimelech, the Philistine King, observes the couple from a window making love in secret and guesses the truth, namely that they are man and wife. He reproves Isaac for the deception, pointing out that any man might have lain with Rebecca in all innocence, not realizing she was a married woman, and would thus have brought dishonour on himself and his people	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	The Jewish Bride	Oil on canvas, 122 x 167 cm	c. 1665	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
08017-dukepast.jpg	The artist painted in Toledo and Madrid. Charles II, successor to Philip IV, viewed him with favour, and in 1669 he was made painter to the King. Although his religious paintings are of unusual quality, his main interest was painting portraits, the finest being that of the Duke Pastrana, now in the Prado.This mature portrait by Carre&#241;o, the impact of the dark and imposing, pyramidal figure of the Duke is counterbalanced by very delicate and melancholic coloring.

10292-04elect2.jpg	John the Steadfast (1468&#151;1532) was a member of the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin. During the lifetime of his brother, Elector Frederick the Wise, he became involved in the business of government. After his brother's death in 1525, John the Steadfast inherited the position of Elector and became Cranach's new master, in which role he proved no less benevolent than Frederick the Wise.One of Cranach's main duties as court painter consisted in portraying the Saxon princes as well as their families and allies. The portraits were not only intended as documentation of the line of descent for royal ancestral galleries, but also as gifts. The mutual exchange of portraits was a court custom, with the result that we know what John the Steadfast looked like from a number of paintings by Cranach.The present half-length portrait shows John the Steadfast in semi-profile at the age of 58. His arms are elided on the left and right edges of the painting, but the work's narrow format lends the portrait an expression of monumental immediacy. Moreover, the sitter stands out by virtue of the signet ring on his left hand, the chain around his neck bearing several rings and a small cross, and above all the rich embroidery on his shirt collar and the precious fur trim on his gown. The garland of carnations in his hair, traditionally worn at weddings, indicates that the portrait might have been painted on the occasion of the betrothal of the sitter's son, John Frederick the Magnanimous, to Sibylle of Cloves in 1526, and that the Elector is depicted here as the father of the groom	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Elector John the Steadfast of Saxony	Oil on lime wood panel, 57 x 37 cm	1526	portrait	German	1501-1550
00973-0fiesol1.jpg	The earliest of Fra Angelico's mural paintings is the Crucified Christ in the Chapter House of San Domenico, the room where the friars, sometimes joined by the laity, assembled for meetings. To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled. The inscriptions - in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - on the titulus of the cross identify Christ as 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.

17094-1arles06.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 412 JH 1440.Van Gogh's production in Arles fell into a number of series, one of which comprised landscape paintings on the theme of the seasons. The original idea for a seasonal series, in which each season would be represented by a pair of complementary colours, had been put forward in Nuenen in 1884. On arrival in Arles in March 1888 van Gogh began to paint a series of canvases of blossoming orchards in pinks and greens entitled Spring. In June he painted Summer in blue and orange, represented by the harvest on the plain of La Crau, which lay between Arles and the ruined monastery of Montmajour. The painting is a pendant of the Haystacks in Provence (F 425). It was an important work for van Gogh; he made two preliminary drawings of the motif and when the painting was finished he made two further drawings after it.In the painting, the viewpoint is high and thus the great plain is laid out beneath us, receding more gradually to the distant towers of Montmajour and the hills beyond. Van Gogh often described the plain of La Crau in his letters, saying that apart from differences of colour it reminded him constantly of Holland, but not of modern Holland. In this landscape he saw the landscape paintings of the seventeenth-century artists Ruisdael and De Koninck, who were both famous for their panoramic landscapes	GOGH, Vincent van	Harvest at La Crau (The Blue Cart)	Oil on canvas, 73 x 92 cm	June 1888, Arles	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

One of these minor artists was Albert Weisgerber, who was already betraying the influence of the Fauves	WEISGERBER, Albert	Riding in the English Gardens, Munich	Oil on canvas, 60 x 71 cm	1910	genre	German	1851-1900
17985-08scene.jpg	"The second row concludes with the Death of the Knight of Celano. It depicts the extensive interior of a private residence which is furnished with a wooden coffered ceiling and a tiled floor. In the centre of the picture a pillared walkway divides the room into two areas. The left half of the picture is missing considerable sections of paint. The depiction of a person sitting at a table has been almost totally destroyed. Nonetheless, the remaining fragments make it possible to identify him. He must be a Franciscan monk, for the lower part of his monastic attire is still visible.The picture combines three scenes: in the left half of a pillared hall with two aisles and a coffered ceiling, St. Francis is prophesying the Knight of Celano's imminent death and begging him to make his confession. The events continue chronologically on the right of the picture. The nobleman's confession to the Franciscan monk is followed in the background by his sudden death.The inscription reads: QUANDO BS.

15588-06tondo.jpg	In 1487, Ghirlandaio painted another Adoration of the Magi, a large circular painting for the Tornabuoni family. The date is confirmed by Roman numerals: MCCCCLXXXVII.Such tondos were particularly popular as decorative items in private rooms, and their circular form required a particularly skillful composition. In the centre the childlike Mary is enthroned with her child. In the background, behind the ruined arcades of a classical building, is a simple hut that provides the ox and ass with a stable and the holy family with shelter. The kings' large retinues are lined up right to the ruin, and only behind the Madonna is there a circle of empty space. In other words the composition is influenced by the form of the panel.On the left is a lovely group of four soldiers with helmets and lances, looking in various directions. The soldiers have four horses that are also looking in different directions. Their pendant on the right, further back, is a group of four other soldiers in magnificent contemporary armor. The horses in front of the ruin are also very successful, and in them Ghirlandaio showed that he was also capable of depicting animals with strong foreshortening and from various angles. The contrast between the magnificent gray stallion and the darker gray ass is surely intentional. Above these animals the observer's gaze wanders through the open arched architecture of the classical ruin out into the far distance. There, painted in an atmospheric paleness, is a city surrounded by water and reminiscent of Venice.The composition of this Adoration contains allusions to the unique panel created in 1481 by Leonardo da Vinci, now in the Galleria degli Uffizi. Though Leonardo never completed this work, it had an enormous influence on the artists of his age. Ghirlandaio adopted the pyramidal composition of the main figures, with Mary at the top. The circular empty space behind Mary in the tondo might also have been inspired by Leonardo's picture.A replica of this tondo, in smaller dimensions and entirely the work of Domenico's shop, is to be found in the Galleria Palatina at Palazzo Pitti in Florence	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Adoration of the Magi	Tempera on wood, diameter: 171 cm	1487	religious	Italian	1451-1500

06606-singerie.jpg	The theme of the 'singerie' was to become widespread in north European art towards the middle of the 17th century, especially in Flanders where artists such as David Teniers the Younger created entire societies out of monkeys dressed as men. Such scenes were intended to allegorise the futility of man's possessions and actions. Singerie is the French word for 'Monkey Trick'. It is a genre depicting monkeys aping human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire.In the present painting it is assumed that the seven monkeys populating the foreground and the four sitting on the draped table surrounding the plate of fruit to be by Jan Brueghel the Elder, with the remaining parts by his son and chief studio assistant at this time, Jan Brueghel the Younger.

00003-rudolf2.jpg	Rudolph II (1552-1612) was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. He became King of Hungary in 1572 and King of Bohemia in 1575. Following the death of his father he also became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. His reign was a troubled time of great religious conflicts coupled with the external menace of the Turks. Unfortunately, politics was not a great interest of his. Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements. As a result, in 1611, he was forced to cede the crown of Bohemia to his brother Matthias and he died soon afterwards	AACHEN, Hans von	Portrait of Emperor Rudolf II	Oil on canvas, 60 x 48 cm	1590s	portrait	German	1601-1650
17815-719goya.jpg	The participation of flagellants in Holy Week processions in Spain was banned in 1777 but evidently not effectively since the ban was published again in 1779 and 1802. Goya's known hatred of fanaticism, explicit in many later drawings and engravings, suggests that his choice of subject was intended as an indictment of this form of public penance. So does his manner of recording the scene. The holy image of the Virgin is silhouetted against the dark wall of the church and the blood-stained figures of the flagellants stand out from and dominate the procession.An Inquisition scene in the same series is similar in character. Both paintings combine realistic reportage with critical intent in a manner, often seeming to approach caricature, which is peculiar to Goya.

23342-07ponte1.jpg	The Angel and the Virgin of the Annunciation are the two upper panels of the polyptych executed by Lotto for the small village Ponteranica in a valley north of Bergamo. The other panels were probably partly completed by assistants, while the protagonists of the Annunciation are among the most fascinating images of Lotto's maturity. Lotto, who was very fond of the theme of the announcement that Mary was to give birth to the son of God, presented the episode in various ways. Here the evocation of the iridescent, almost incorporeal angel confers a dream-like fascination on the event, which is, however, placed on a plane of worldly normality by the Virgin's gesture and expression.The angel in the upper left compartment of the polyptych is one of the most lyric creations of Lotto	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Angel Annunciating	Oil on wood, 75 x 55 cm	1527	religious	Italian	1501-1550

11198-1880s_18.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	The Tub	Pastel on paper, 70 x 70 cm	1885-86	genre	French	1851-1900
18264-0803grec.jpg	El Greco painted many representations of St Francis, all showing him in meditation, receiving the stigmata or experiencing a vision. Devotion to St Francis was highly developed in Spain, and in El Greco's time there were in Toledo alone ten Franciscan religious institutions. Many ordinary Toledans were members of the Third Order of Saint Francis, established so that lay people could participate in the spiritual life of the Franciscans. (El Greco himself was a lay Franciscan.) This serves to explain the success of El Greco's images of the saint.

Trumpets announce the arrival of Fame from the globe on which the allegorical figure stands and knights arrive to honour her.The feathers on the frame are a reference to Lorenzo's father Piero de Gouty, and the reverse of the tondo features other references to the Medici, as well as to the family of Lorenzo's mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni	SCHEGGIA	Triumph of Fame (a Birth Salver)	Tempera, silver and gold on wood, diameter 93 cm (with frame)	c. 1449	other	Italian	1401-1450

19086-04nooff.jpg	The portrait of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard is the first major group portrait by Frans Hals, and the first monumental civic guard painting in the new era of Dutch painting. Together with the leaders of public, charitable and professional associations, the civic guard societies were the main patrons to commission group portraits. This patronage took on considerable proportions in the course of the century. These group portraits are also of value as historical documents, for which lists were drawn up giving the names of the figures portrayed. The paintings themselves were displayed prominently on the premises of the respective association.These civic guard portraits were an expression of the Baroque will to representation, whose tradition is rooted in the medieval era. There had been civic guards in the Netherlands since the 13th century. They had played an important role in the emancipation of the cities and towns from feudal rule and had gained considerable political and military significance in the Netherlands' struggle for independence.Cornelis van Haarlem had already painted the officers of the St George Civic Guard in 1599. Hals, however, revolutionizes this type of painting. Instead of merely painting a row of individual portraits, he places them within a specific context by creating a banquet scene. This is not simply a moment captured at a table, but an extremely witty and calculated composition in which a scenic context is created between all the figures involved, and, on the other hand, each of the figures poses and acts independently and individually. Hals has found a new and persuasive solution to the problem of portraying a large group without difference of rank.Hals seems to have arranged the officers casually around the festive board. But this is not the case. The places they occupy are in strict accord with military protocol.

They are flanked by the company's three captains and the three lieutenants are at the lower end of the table. The three ensigns, who were not members of the officer corps, and the servant stand.

30406-madchild.jpg	"In the inventory of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's paintings compiled by Giovanni Battista Agucchi in 1603, a double-sided picture is mentioned, with a Nativity on one side and a Madonna on the other. In 1638 the painting was left by Ippolito Aldobrandini to his only niece Olimpia, who had married for a second time to Camillo Pamphilj senior. In a list of the same property made prior to 1665, the work is recorded as still being in one piece, ""with gilded frame at the front of the Parmigianino [and] with a pedestal covered with crimson velvet and gold trimming."" The work was obviously held in high regard, and probably intended, from the outset, for use as a small altar for private devotion.The votive picture was still in this state in 1709 and only subsequently split into two separate parts. Before this investigation of the archives was carried out, the two pictures had been considered two separate works intended as companion pieces. Curiously, in 1603 Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's collection contained another small Nativity surrounded by angels, also by Parmigianino but not the same as the one here.This delightful example of sacred painting with its curved and supple lines, in which the Madonna with her hands joined in moving and gentle spirituality and the Child with a dove perched on an open book, undoubtedly inspired by Correggio, are set against a background of trees stirred by a light breeze, probably dates from around 1525. It would therefore have been painted at the time of the Fontanellato frescoes, that is prior to the artist's stay in Rome"	PARMIGIANINO	Madonna and Child	Oil on panel (arched), 58,8 x 34,1 cm	c. 1525	religious	Italian	1501-1550
29282-214muril.jpg	According to tradition, the models were from the province of Galicia and attained a certain notoriety as courtesans in Seville. A man of the people, Murillo obviously intended this picture to both surprise and amuse the spectator. Yet the casualness of this painting masks a sure sense design - note how the girls' heads form a diagonal that bisects the canvas - and great technical skill. Although he had begun by selling his pictures at fairs, Murillo became conversant with and influenced by the works of Velázquez, Titian and Rubens, presumably as a result of studying the royal collections in Madrid. But Murillo never lost his popular appeal or his gift for the telling expression, such as the smile of the uppermost woman, indicated only by her eyes and cheeks	MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban	A Girl and her Duenna	Oil on canvas, 106 x 127 cm	1670	genre	Spanish	1651-1700
39630-2rabbit.jpg	"In 1529  Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua ordered three more works from Titian. The only one to survive is probably identifiable with the Madonna and Child with St Catherine and a Shepherd, known as the Madonna of the Rabbit. With a look of winning encouragement the Virgin restrains the rabbit, a symbol of fecundity, so that the child can clamber down and play with it. The richly dressed St Catherine, proffering her charge like a lady-in- waiting, introduces a courtly aspect, and in fact the Giorgionesque shepherd in the background may be a portrait of Federico himself: Since x-rays show that the Madonna's head was originally turned in his direction. In the foreground, the delicate wild flowers recall the locus amoenus or ""idyllic setting"" of classical poetry, and in the park-like landscape we see the Arcadia of the Concert Champ&#234;tre refracted through the smiling fertility of the Ferrara Bacchanals. Nowhere else does Titian so successfully integrate the traditions of the Sacra Conversazione and the Pastoral.This painting mainly captivates through the beauty of its colours and the marvellous landscape. The small format is a sign that this was a private devotional picture. What at first sight appears to be a normal picture of the Madonna gains an additional, very private dimension as a result"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Madonna and Child with St Catherine and a Rabbit	Oil on canvas, 74 x 84 cm	1530	religious	Italian	1501-1550
04836-vanitas.jpg	The painting shows a sarcophagus in a half-ruined church, with its vanishing point on the left. Objects of vanity are assembled in the foreground, piled up in the shape of a pyramid and culminating in an ermine coat, a turban (at the very top, at the banister, next to the skull), a royal crown, a mitre and a globe. These symbols of secular and ecclesiastical power at the zenith of the composition are further explained by a richly decorated bowl, worked by a goldsmith. It shows mythological scenes of unhappy love relationships, partly covering those 'vanitates' which are of lower order - a tambourine, lute, sabre, coat of mail and painter's palette, to name but a few. The statue of a mourning female figure in one of the niches bears great resemblance to the woman whose contours can be seen in Nicolas Poussin's famous self-portrait  at the Louvre. She can be regarded as a late successor to the weeping women who surround the altar tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon.Pieter Boel's painting contains all the features normally associated with baroque solemnity, i.e. pomp and splendour even where power and wealth have become subject to the darkness of death. However, although all earthly possessions and authority are marked as vain, the dialectic of the painting never leaves any doubt that their real substance remains undisputed in this world and that the earthly order is preserved intact	BOEL, Pieter	Large Vanitas Still-Life	Oil on canvas, 207 x 260 cm	1663	still-life	Flemish	1651-1700

10001-lastjudg.jpg	This work illustrate the influence exerted in the Low Countries by the Italian Renaissance. A variety of artists made the journey to Italy in the 16th century, where they absorbed the new artistic ideas. Their work brought an entirely new approach to religious painting compared to the pious, inward-looking art of the 15th century. Novel elements included brilliant compositions and above all the heightened attention to the human body - a focus that led to frequent exaggeration.Coxcie's Last Judgment is a rather unsuccessful attempt to match the anatomical skills of the great Italian masters. It was painted for the Town Hall in Ghent, to replace a 15th-century Last Judgment that was destroyed during the mid-16th-century Iconoclasm.

35538-01medici.jpg	Thanks to his organisational capacities, Rubens could meet demand and revolutionise the problem of large-scale pictorial decoration. His renown extended well beyond the frontiers of his country, and in 1621 Marie de Médicis, widow of Henri IV of France and mother of the reigning king Louis XIII, invited him to Paris. She wished him to decorate one of the galleries of the newly built Palais de Luxembourg with 24 monumental paintings commemorating episodes in the lives of herself and her renowned husband. The creation of a cycle of tapestries had, in a sense, been Rubens' technical apprenticeship for this demanding task, the composition of a cycle of vast narrative paintings dedicated to a living queen who had already entered history.Giving epic treatment to this biographical subject, Rubens was also able to give free rein to his fertile invention. He prepared two series of oil sketches, with detailed figures drawn in, which it then fell to his assistants to scale up to the dimensions of the canvases commissioned. These were then meticulously retouched by the master so that they might be ultimately be described, at least in the final layers of paint, as his own works. The entire commission was completed in only three years.All of his prodigious culture was drawn on for these works: his encyclopaedic knowledge of classical mythology was exploited to the full in transforming the queen's entire career - Henri slipped rather into the background - into a kind of operatic sequence largely of Rubens' own invention. Metamorphosing life into myth, he freely mingled historical personages with the gods of Olympus, who came to represent them. The scheme of this apparatus was invented as he went along, the - often gratuitous - interpolations of the divine gracefully leavening the uneventful royal life. It had required all of Rubens' imaginative resources and natural verve to ennoble and illustrate the relatively colourless circumstances of the Queen Mother's life. These qualities were essential; Rubens' international renown depended on his success in this formidable commission. His solution was to populate his compositions with nude goddesses, pagan gods, curvaceous undines, mischievous tritons, and genii unspecified. His customary contrasts are at work in the playful opposition of gleaming cuirasses and lusty bodies, fragile silks and the rugged hulls of dreadnoughts. The poverty of his subject was utterly transcended; this is pure painting, nothing but painting.Certainly, it was not the rather heavy features of the Medici family, particularly evident in the queen, that had attracted Henri IV, but the scale of her dowry. Rubens nevertheless contrived to render her portrait agreeable. He disguised her now as an attractive Bellona, now as a proud horsewoman in The Capture of Juliers. The royal couple become Olympian deities in The Meeting of Marie de Médicis and Henri IV at Lyon, while The Fate Spinning Marie's Destiny and The Triumph of Truth became pretexts for a proliferation of female convexity	RUBENS, Peter Paul	The Landing of Marie de Médicis at Marseilles	Oil on canvas, 394 x 295 cm	1623-25	historical	Flemish	1601-1650
37530-5domeni.jpg	In the Cappella di Santa Caterina of the Sienese church of San Domenico, Sodoma's mural paintings dominate the decoration. The chapel was built in the late fifteenth century to house the relic of St Catherine's head in a marble tabernacle. Sodoma transformed the space to appear as if it were an open loggia resting on piers. The real altar is continued to the side as a painted balustrade, above which, in a wide opening on the left Catherine is seen fainting and, on the right, in ecstasy.Only the left-hand wall showing Catherine saving the soul of Niccol&#242; di Tuldo was completed by Sodoma. Here the artist uses particular means to bring us close to the scene: the lower balustrade is wide open; steps seem to lead out of the chapel to the site of the execution	SODOMA, Il	View of the Cappella di Santa Caterina	Fresco	1526	religious	Italian	1501-1550
39795-18barbar.jpg	This portrait is considered to be a replica in his own hand of an almost identical portrait in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, which identifies the subject as Daniele Barbaro in an inscription. The picture in Ottawa is probably that mentioned in 1545 in a letter from Pietro Aretino, which once belonged to the portrait collection of Paolo Giovio in Como. With the body turned slightly to the right and the grave, spiritual face framed by the beard and hair, Daniele Barbaro's gaze is fixed on the viewer. His black gown reveals scarcely anything except the left hand and the book, which, as an attribute of scholarship, alludes to Barbaro's humanistic education.

11016-410david.jpg	While Pope Pius VII remained in Paris after the consecration, David also painted his portrait and thereby joined an illustrious band of past artists - Raphael, Titian and Velázquez - as the painter of a pontiff. David broke with protocol by sitting down while he worked, as previously tradition had dictated that the humble artist should kneel to paint the Pope. David, though, did appreciate the honour bestowed upon him and apparently put on fine clothes and wore a sword as he worked. He responded warmly to the venerable old pontiff and was both delighted and moved by the benediction that he received from the hand of Pius	DAVID, Jacques-Louis	Portrait of Pope Pius VII	Oil on canvas, 86 x 71 cm	1805	portrait	French	1801-1850
39752-01schiav.jpg	The portraits from the early period of Titian are strongly realistic. Among them the portrait of a woman, called La Schiavone, is of remarkably fine quality. Titian poses his sitters in such a way as to make the most of a novel compositional idea; the figures stand out in bold relief against the plain background and the colour emphasizes the unusual lighting, revealing the mood of the sitters as well as capturing their physical presence.The inclusion of the sitter's portrait carved in stone may refer to the much discussed issue of the relative merits of painting and sculpture	TIZIANO Vecellio	Portrait of a Woman (La Schiavona)	Oil on canvas, 117 x 97 cm	1508-10	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

The artist arranged the scene himself  as if it were a tableau vivante according to the fashion of those days. Borsos, who portrayed the life of  the upper class,  tested himself as a stage director. The spell of the night, gossip and musing, a kind of freshness which made the artist want to arrest the irrevocable charm of the moment. The artist's daughter was one of the models.

10246-1founta1.jpg	Cranach's painting is about the human yearning for immortality and eternal youth. Human beings dream of being young again, of leaving the worn outer shell and exchanging it for a new one. The notion of the cleansing power of the elements, especially of water, is as old as humankind itself. The centre of the scene is a pool filled with water. Some steps lead down to the pool, which is surrounded by a fantastic landscape far from civilisation. People have undertaken arduous journeys to reach this solitary spot and bathe in the miraculous waters.In the left half of the picture wrinkled and frail old women are brought up on carts and stretchers. They are undressed and examined by a doctor before stepping into the water where the gradual process of rejuvenation takes place. Their wrinkles and old sallow skin disappear, their flesh becomes rosy and smooth, and they turn into young girls. As they emerge from the water they are welcomed by a cavalier who shows them to a tent where they receive new clothes. Old peasant women are transformed into young ladies of the court who indulge in the carefree pleasures of life. The jollifications at the festive table, the dancing, music and lovemaking, all take place in a lush flowering landscape. These are the realms of eternal youth, to which the hardships of old age, set in a barren rocky landscape on the left side of the picture, form a stark contrast.The fountain spouting water from the spring into the pool bears the statues of Venus and Cupid - evidence that this is actually a fountain of love rather than youth, and that the power of love is the true source of immortality	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	The Fountain of Youth	Lime panel, 122,5 x 186,5 cm	1546	mythological	German	1501-1550
43381-triptych.jpg	In this grandiose triptych Antonio Vivarini, helped by his brother-in-law Giovanni d'Alemagna (active 1441-1450), achieved a highpoint of balance between the International Gothic tradition now in decline, and the rising Renaissance. A natural light lends tenderness to the holy figures. The Virgin, however, sits rigid like a Byzantine empress on a Gothic throne, surrounded by Masolinoesque angels who are holding the poles of the high canopy almost as if it were a game. The saints Gregory and Jerome on the left and Ambrose and Augustine on the right, stand immobile in their heavy ecclesiastical garments shining with gold and colour. The holy scene appears constrained by the marble walls with their Gothic fretwork, set in a perspective as improbable as it is ostentatious. The sumptuous static scene is a final dazzling reminder of a fairy-tale world	VIVARINI, Antonio	Triptych	Tempera on panel, 339 x 200 cm (central), 339 x 138 cm (each side)	1446	religious	Italian	1401-1450
09698-04sabine.jpg	The Sacchetti family commissioned this painting in the 1620s when Pietro da Cortona was just making his name in Roman circles. They thus became his first patrons and introduced him to the world of aristocratic commissions. During the first two decades of the century, Caravaggio's naturalistic style had been rivaled by the Carracci cousins' academic style of classicism. Each school had its own followers and some attempts had been made to bring the two together. The arrival of Pietro da Cortona, at the same time as Bernini erupted onto the scene as the preferred sculptor and architect of the Barberini pope Urban VIII, were together sufficient to transform art in Rome and to create a true Baroque style.Pietro da Cortona's painting stands out for its open theatricality, lively gestures, richness of colour, and brushwork, as well as its diffused light. The Sabine women being lifted into the air deliberately derive from Bernini's works, such as Apollo and Daphne, as if to underline the bond between the two artists. There is little real violence in his treatment of this scene from Roman legend, merely a splendidly theatrical display of half-clothed bodies	CORTONA, Pietro da	The Rape of the Sabine Women	Oil on canvas, 280,5 x 426 cm	1627-29	historical	Italian	1601-1650
35708-jewish_c.jpg	Ruins sometimes play a prominent role, and gloomy skies set a melancholy mood. Ruisdael's rare ability to create a compelling and tragic mood in nature is best seen in his famous Jewish Cemetery at Dresden. A larger, more elaborate autograph version is at the Detroit Institute of Arts. These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme. The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas. The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized. They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam. Ruisdael made carefully worked-up drawings of the tombs, one of which he used as a preparatory drawing for the paintings. But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk. They are Ruisdael's inventions. The cemetery never had monumental ruins. Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing. The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church. A rushing stream does not bisect the actual burial ground. (Would anyone in his right mind place tombs near a vigorous stream which would wreak havoc with the tombstones and coffins beneath them when it flooded?) The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time. Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards. If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes. He made no others that can be given a similar unmistakable reading. None of his other existing paintings include tombs; those done by his contemporaries are rare, and some of them are based on his depictions of the sarcophagi at Ouderkerk. However, Ruisdael made numerous pictures that include identifiable or imaginary ruins, dead and broken trees, rushing streams, rivers, and waterfalls. Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope? It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting. According to this interpretation they were intended as visual sermons to convey the biblical message that man lives in a transient world beset by sinful temptation, but may hope for salvation	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	The Jewish Cemetery	Oil on canvas, 141 x 183 cm	c 1657	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

Later, when the Troyan were washed ashore near Carthage after the storm at sea, Aeneas and his friend Achates set out to explore Venus appeared once more, this time with bow and quiver disguised as a huntress, to direct them to Dido's palace.This painting depicts the moment in which Venus appears to the Trojan warriors disguised as a huntress and directs them to Queen Dido's palace	GIMIGNANI, Giacinto	Venus Appearing to Aeneas and Achates	Oil on canvas, 122 x 170 cm	-	religious	Italian	1601-1650

Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires.

07597-57salome.jpg	On his way back to Rome Caravaggio returned to Naples. This harsh late work has none of the beauty of some of the late Sicilian pictures, such as the altarpiece stolen from the Oratory of San Lorenzo in Palermo, and it may reflect the assault Caravaggio endured in the Osteria del Cerriglio in the city. A sense of the tired mood of one aware of the pointlessness of a ruthless vendetta pervades the painting.The Baptist has been executed for denouncing Salome's mother Herodias over her illicit marriage with Herod. Caravaggio uses the device of planting two heads - Salome's and her maid's (or her mother's) - so close together that they seem to grow out of one body as the contrasting stages of youth and age. This had been a trait of Leonardo's, and the way that the head of St John is presented to the spectator recalls a picture by Leonardo's pupil Luini, whose Salome also looks away from her victim. The executioner takes no joy in what he has been commanded to do. He feels only a stunned emotion in keeping with the sombre tones that Caravaggio adopts.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

33433-01oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 486.This painting dates from shortly after Rembrandt had set up as an independent artist in Leiden in 1625. The subject is taken from the Apocryphal Book of Tobit (Chapter II, vv, 11-14). Tobit was a wealthy, God-fearing Jew, strict in his observance of the Mosaic law, who had lost all his money and been blinded in an accident. To keep them from starving, his wife Anna took in sewing and washing. One day, hearing the bleating of a kid which Anna had been given to supplement her earnings, Tobit falsely accuses her of having stolen it. In return, she upbraids him for his self-righteousness which has brought them to their present plight (this is the scene represented in the picture). Later, however, the couple's fortunes are restored by their son, Tobias, who goes to find the money his father has lost and to marry a rich wife. On the way he meets the Angel Raphael, who instructs him when they come to a river to catch a large fish, the entrails of which are afterwards applied to Tobit's eyes to cure his blindness.In this work Rembrandt depicts the psychological tension between the two protagonists. The mood of the blind old Tobit suddenly becomes one of suspicion and despair when he wonders how his wife, Anna, has managed to lay hands on a kid. She in turn is baffled by his mistrust.The space depicted is confined but packed with domestic detail: onions hanging up by the window, a basket on the wall, cooking utensils on the shelves, part of Anna's sewing apparatus glimpsed between the two figures, and, in the foreground, Tobit's stick, his dog and a modest fire.Such meticulously painted still-life detail had been a characteristic of Netherlandish art since the fifteenth century. However, in contrast to so many examples of its use up to and including the seventeenth century, it appears here to be without ulterior symbolic meaning; the purpose is to give the maximum reality to the events of the story	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Tobit Accusing Anna of Stealing the Kid	Oil on panel, 40 x 30 cm	1626	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

34656-louvre2.jpg	Hubert Robert painted many views, both real and imaginary, of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. His imaginary vies really constitute a set of designs for an ideal museum. When he painted this picture (the finest in the series) in 1796, the Galley was nothing but an interminably long corridor, lit only by side windows, which linked the Louvre to the Tuileries. The architects who were later responsible for the lighting and redecoration of the Grande Galerie were merely executing the original ideas of Hubert Robert. In this painting several of the masterpieces of the Museum Central can be recognized, notably Raphael's Holy Family of François I and Titian's Entombment	ROBERT, Hubert	Design for the Grande Galerie in the Louvre	Oil on canvas, 112 x 143 cm	1796	interior	French	1751-1800
00849-35_eucha.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 35 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. The Institute of the Eucharist in Cell 35 underscored the Dominicans devotion to the Eucharist, which St Thomas articulated most eloquently in composing the office for the feast of Corpus Domini. It transpires in a spacious room similar to the convent's actual refectory and repeats elements of San Marco's own architecture - the arched windows of the dormitory, the well in the second cloister - to emphasize its relevance to the lay brother.This fresco was executed by an assistant of Fra Angelico	ANGELICO, Fra	Institution of the Eucharist (Cell 35)	Fresco, 186 x 234 cm	1441-42	religious	Italian	1401-1450

00361-flight_e.jpg	The forested landscapes of Alsloot often incorporate views of castles and abbeys located in the Foret de Soignes, near Brussels, a frequent source of inspiration. The building depicted with topographical accuracy in its lakeside setting in the present painting can be identified as the ch&#226;teau at Tervueren, an important site tied to the Brussels court.

04577-pendant1.jpg	"A child teasing a cat is a frequent subject in Dutch art; it refers to the idea that (sexual) teasing can lead to a painful scratching. That this mischievous girl is partially disrobed makes the consequences more obvious and erotic-since her bared skin teases the viewer as well. Her voluptuousness and apparent cheerfulness suggest a brothel, not the everyday life of children.Van Bijlert, a leading master in Utrecht, owes his sensual treatment of the human body to the influence of his teacher Abraham Bloemaert and the paintings by the great Italian master Caravaggio that he saw while in Rome (1621-24/25), such as the latter's melancholic, starkly sensual The Musicians,"" from which he apparently adapted the shoulder and arm of the boy at the right"	BIJLERT, Jan van	Girl Teasing a Cat	Oil on panel, 42 x 33 cm	c. 1630	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
11590-holyfami.jpg	"The subject of this painting is unusual, a variation on the traditional theme of the Sacra Conversazione, a venerable one among Florentine painters. In this representation, the mature Christ is shown between the Virgin and his father St Joseph. He gazes upward at the Holy Spirit and above him God the Father. The combination of the figures, therefore, void of other extraneous saints, represents the ""Celestial"" and ""Terrestrial"" Trinities together."

38442-10szinye.jpg	"The artist never accepted commissions to paint portraits; all the portraits he painted featured members of his family. These representations, each of which is a pearl of intimate Realism, reach the soul of the model. Szinyei began to paint portraits of this wife on several occasions, but he was not always able to finish them, because his wife, in sharp contrast with Szinyei's contemplating character, was ever so busy that she had difficulty tolerating the modelling sessions. She set both for the famous ""Woman in Lilac Dress"" (1874) and for the ""Portrait in Shawl"". The latter portrait was not finished in 1880: the deep scarlet coloured velvet dress his wife is shown wearing was completed only around 1890, long after the couple's divorce in 1887. (In actual fact Szinyei's daughter was sitting as model.) The painting is dominated by the delicate and sensitive beauty of the model's face, radiating from the background of warm colours. In Szinye's pictures, the women are often shown wearing in their hair or on their hats colourful flowers, or as in the case of ""Portrait in Shawl"", laces and ribbons. We can almost be certain that he did not use them just to conform with the fashion of the age. These colourful patches were necessary to emphasize the beauty of the face and the fine rosiness of the skin, as well as to produce a definite separation from the dark background"	SZINYEI MERSE, Pál	Portrait of the Artist's Wife	Oil on canvas, 63 x 47 cm	1880	portrait	Hungarian	1851-1900

03673-the_duet.jpg	A young woman strums her lute in an expansive, stone interior. A male accompanist, whose crude facial features contrast pointedly with the more delicate ones of his companion, sings and plays the violin beside her. His plain outfit differs from his friends elegant attire. The lavish fabrics are complemented by the expensive instruments: in addition to the violin and lute, a bass violin rests against the bench in the foreground while a shawm, the ancestor of the oboe, lies just above it. Costly music books are also heaped beside the figures. The murky, grayish-brown background of this ambiguous, lapidary setting also contains a large ewer and expansive curtain whose knots and folds echo the fabric encasing the lutenist.

01103-manportr.jpg	The painting is one of the portraits which were famed for their realism. Due to his knowledge of Flemish pictures, the painter had made a decisive contribution to the spreading and perfection in Italy of what was at that time the new medium of oil painting, and normally depicted figures in three quarter life-size as statue-like half-length portraits in front of a barrier. As in this portrait, the face is particularly emphasized by the dark background and simple headgear, with the eyes directed straight at the observer	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Man	Oil on wood, 32 x 26 cm	1474	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

29410-bonnier.jpg	Joseph Bonnier de la Mosson (1702-1744) was the scion of a family of well-to-do cloth merchants from the southern French city of Montpellier. He served as an officer in the French royal army until the death of his father in 1726. He was a polymath who prided himself on his knowledge of literature, music, and the sciences. He died unexpectedly on July 26, 1744.Nattier began Bonnier's portrait in early 1744, the year of the sitter's death; he signed and dated the canvas the following year. The portrait has few rivals in French portraiture of the time, not only for the elegance of its composition and the refinement of its colouring, but also for its vivid delineation of character	NATTIER, Jean-Marc	Joseph Bonnier de la Mosson	Oil on canvas, 138 x 105 cm	1745	portrait	French	1701-1750

11128-early19.jpg	Many of Degas's drawings and studies of movement after 1860 are inspired by race-course scenes.

He was similarly influenced by Japanese woodblock prints.

12493-08lotdau.jpg	This delightfully spontaneous panel depicts Lot and his two daughters fleeing from the destruction of Sodom. In the story from Genesis, two angels warn Lot that he should escape before God destroys the city for its sins. Lot is told that his family must not look back, otherwise they will be turned into pillars of salt.In Dürer's panel, Lot leads the way, dressed in a warm fur-lined coat and a magnificent turban. He carries a basket of eggs and has a flask of wine slung over his shoulder on his stick. His two daughters follow several paces behind, one bearing a bundle on her head and the other with an elegant casket and a distaff and yarn. Far behind them, near the towering rocks, is Lot's wife, transformed into a brown pillar of salt. In the distance the town of Sodom explodes with brimstone and fire, huge columns of smoke belching up into the sky. Gomorrah, in the far distance, suffers a similar fate.This depiction of Lot's flight is not the main picture, but the reverse of a panel of the Virgin and Child. The two sides are quite different, not only in subject-matter but also in style. The Lot panel is painted in a loose, spontaneous manner, whereas the Virgin and Child is much more finely worked. However, Dürer must have intended them to be seen together. The panel was painted for the Nuremberg merchant family of Haller, whose arms appear in the bottom left corner of the panel of the Virgin.Virgin and Child at a Window was long assumed to be the work of the Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini, because of its composition and colouring. In 1934 it was identified as a Dürer, painted about three years after his return from Venice. It was bought by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza, who owned it until 1950	DÜRER, Albrecht	Lot Fleeing with his Daughters from Sodom	Oil and tempera on panel, 52 x 41 cm	c. 1498	religious	German	1501-1550
18370-1605grec.jpg	In collaboration with his son Jorge Manuel in 1603-07, El Greco executed an extensive programme of pictures for the Hospital de la Caridad in Illescas: a Madonna of Charity, a Coronation of the Virgin, an Annunciation, and a Nativity. Under a separate contract a further picture was made, of St Ildefonso, who was particularly important for Toledo. The painting is in the side altar on the left of the main chapel of the church, balancing the Virgin of Charity. Its original place in the church is not known. The painting is not mentioned in the incomplete documentation for the decoration of the chapel, and if, as is probable, it was not painted at the same time, it cannot date much before June 1603, the date of the contract, and was more likely painted soon after the conclusion of litigation in August 1607. In its present position, it makes a grand pair to the Virgin of Charity, and is one of the most splendid of his 'portraits' of Saints.It is difficult, and perhaps not proper, to separate his portraits of Saints from his actual portraits. In both he employs all his means of spiritual or psychological expression. The legend is that Saint Ildefonso, the first Bishop of Toledo, presented an image of the Virgin of the Mantle to a foundation of his in Illescas. The Saint is portrayed before the same image, as he wrote his dissertation on the Purity of the Virgin. The state of inspiration is brilliantly expressed. There is an infinite distinction in expression between the hand poised with the pen in this 'portrait' and the similar motif in the portrait of his son.In his depiction of St Ildefonso, El Greco anticipated a Baroque motif, that of the learned churchman. As if receiving inspiration, the saint is seated at a desk covered with an array of utensils that is unusually detailed for the artist.There is a smaller replica of the picture in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It belonged once to the painter Jean François Millet, and later to Edgar Degas	GRECO, El	St Ildefonso	Oil on canvas, 187 x 102 cm	1603-05	religious	Spanish	1551-1600
11143-1870s_08.jpg	From 1870 Degas increasingly painted ballet subjects. First he painted a series of ballet rehearsal pictures. The Foyer of the Opera at Rue Le Peletier shows ten ballerinas being examined in the great hall. The white-clad Louis François Mérante, instructor at the opera house, is giving orders which the dancers have to follow. Those who are not busy exercising are watching the ballerina currently being examined with close attention. The work is organized around the polarity of group and single figure. The scene, remarkable for the rigour of its composition, has a distinctive energy centre in the vacant chair at the fore	DEGAS, Edgar	The Foyer of the Opera at Rue Le Peletier	Oil on canvas, 32 x 46 cm	1872	other	French	1851-1900

The angels offers to grant Valerian one wish, and Valerian asks that his brother Tiburtius might also convert to Christianity. The scene to the left in the middle distance depicts the discussion between Valerian, Tiburtius, and Cecilia about Christ's Passion and his earthly succession - a discussion that took place before Tiburtius received baptism.

16602-stucco.jpg	For the decoration of the loggia, Raphael devised the scheme and provided the compositions for the narratives, while the actual work was delegated to the most senior assistants. Giulio Romano took charge of the figurative scenes with Gianfrancesco Penni collaborating on the preparation of the cartoons and Giovanni da Udine as overseer of the decorative areas. As part of the decorative scheme, there is a series of reliefs on the pilasters.

34219-s_onufri.jpg	Ribera studied in Francisco Ribalta's workshop in Valencia, but when still young he went to Naples, then under Spanish rule, where he worked for the rest of his life. He was called there as Lo Spagnoletto. He obtained most of his commissions from the Spanish Viceroy and his entourage, but he also completed a good many paintings for the churches of the city.The influence of Caravaggio was felt throughout southern Italy and there can be little doubt that Ribera was the artist with the strongest and most independent personality of all his followers. Ribera represented crude reality boldly and without embellishment. The construction of his pictures is monumental and he reveals a strong sense of drama, empahasized by means of strongly contrasting light and shade. The poor inhabitants of Naples and the peasants of southern Italy were his models, and he depicted them without flattery or idealization as enormous figures clothed in rags. The painting of Saint Onufri also shows the influence of Caravaggio	RIBERA, Jusepe de	Saint Onufri	Oil on canvas, 130 x 104 cm	1637	religious	Spanish	1601-1650
20797-virgin_c.jpg	The composition of this remarkably refined little painting is based on a lost small work by Memling, which is best reflected in the Virgin of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Since the dimensions correspond, the work must have been done with a tracing or punch-cardboard based on the original. The version discussed here shows the image in the right direction. The Virgin is represented high above a landscape, more monumental than the prototype. She stands behind a wall over which a white cloth is draped with very heavy folds. This also differs from the model. The panel was incorrectly ascribed to Michel Sittow, and later attributed to Juan de Flandes in 1966. On account of the quality, the typical facial features and the vaporous green-grey landscape, this attribution cannot be doubted. The panel originated about the time of the Retablo Mayor of Palencia (c. 1510) and may have been the central panel of a small triptych described in the accounts of Palencia Cathedral as the 'tabla oratorio de tress pieças'. If so, it could have been a work in the style of Memling's Triptych of Benedetto Portinari (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi), with a donor and a saint in front of a continuous landscape on the wings	JUAN DE FLANDES	Virgin and Child before a Landscape	Oil on panel, 26 x 19,5 cm	c. 1510	religious	Spanish	1501-1550

31940-03josep3.jpg	The painting belongs to the series of four entitled Scenes from the Life of Joseph the Hebrew, now in the National Gallery, London. These works, together with others by Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci, Bachiacca and Franciabigio, were intended for the decoration of the nuptial chamber of Francesco Borgherini and Margherita Acciaioli, who married in 1515. The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner. He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other. The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin. The painting is divided into four distinct zones. In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino. On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting. A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background. Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background. On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother. Lastly, Joseph and his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are portrayed inside the room at the top of the building, where Jacob, now old and near to death, imparts his paternal blessing. The curious combination of all these elements confers to the painting an anomalous and intriguing quality	PONTORMO, Jacopo	Joseph in Egypt	Oil on wood, 96 x 109 cm	1515-18	religious	Italian	1501-1550
43591-9marymag.jpg	This painting, formerly given to Pomarancio, has been reattributed to Simon Vouet. It may perhaps be identifiable with the Magdalene cited with an attribution to Sacchi in the 1648-49 inventory of the Palazzo Barberini at Monterotondo.The painting, which shows some stylistic and typological connections with the Vouet's David in Palazzo Bianco in Genoa, could date from the years (c. 1623-27) in which the French artist was in close contact with the Barberini, ending with his departure for France. Though the canvas is certainly rich in Caravaggesque qualities, Vouet is already showing himself as a full participant in the new classicism that was on the rise in the Roman art scene. At the same time he also shows signs of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome.This painting poses interesting problems on account of its close compositional connections to the Magdalene by Guido Reni, dated to 1631-32 (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). The cut of the scene anticipates the composition that Vouet adopted for his Portrait of Gaucher de Chatillon (Louvre, Paris), carried out for the Palace of Cardinal Richelieu between 1633 and 1634. Dominated by the monumental figure of the Magdalene, the picture opens out to a luxuriant perspectival landscape view in the left background. Another highly interesting element is the close stylistic analogy between the Magdalene and Vouet's Allegory of Peace, that was also in the Barberini collection (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). As the Allegory has been attributed to an anonymous brother of the Cavalier Muti (a student of Vouet and Claude Mellan), the similarities between the two pictures lead to basic questions about the true authorship of this extraordinary painting	VOUET, Simon	St Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 241 x 171 cm	1623-27	religious	French	1601-1650
26364-corsini.jpg	The picture shows the ceiling fresco in the reading room of the library of the Accademia dei Lincei in the Palazzo Corsini.The shape of the frame alludes to Pietro da Cortona's ceiling in Santa Maria in Vallicella. This frame, especially characteristic of Rome, was popular both in sacred and secular contexts, and was also frequently used in horizontal-format compositions. The ceiling in the library of Palazzo Corsini, painted by the Florentine Vincenzo Meucci, is a good example. Befitting the stature of the Corsini family, which supplied a pope in Clement XII, the pictorial program combines motifs alluding to the function of the library (church fathers and scholars) with the personification of Ecclesia, angels, putti, virtues, and vanquished vices	MEUCCI, Vincenzo	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	c. 1747	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

38938-02gesuat.jpg	The fresco is the largest version of this subject in European art, and it combines two different iconographic traditions: in the upper part of the picture, the Rosenkranzbild, in which Mary gives the Rosary to mankind, and, in the lower part, a depiction of the beneficence of the Rosary on earth, represented by St Dominic. As well as the Madonna of the Rosary, the fresco also extols St Dominic, the founder of the Dominican order, to whom the dog is a reference (lat. domini canes, God's hounds). All manner of people are portrayed - represented among others by the Doge, a Turk, a nun, and a mother and child, a symbol of Christian charity - so that the viewer, whether rich or poor, could identify with them	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Institution of the Rosary	Fresco, 1200 x 450 cm	1737-39	religious	Italian	1701-1750

21312-03sebast.jpg	There is a group of painting attributed to Georges de La Tour depicting St Sebastian and St Irene. Part of them is a horizontal composition where the model of one of the figures is a familiar La Tour type. Most of the versions are curiously incompetent, only three of them having pretensions to quality. The upright versions of the same subject (one in the Louvre and the other in Berlin) are more celebrated. The composition is monumental, as if the painting were depicting a sculptured tableau.The Louvre composition is especially moving, with the mourning figure in a blue cowl (in the Berlin version the cowl is black) looking as if she were taken from a piece of Burgundian tomb sculpture. Recent observations on the possible dating of the costumes have left little doubt that the picture is rather later than the artist's lifetime. Étienne de La Tour, the son of the artist was suggested (but not accepted) as the possible author. Étienne de La Tour is actually documented as being required to continue his father's style, should the latter die inopportunately, and it is likely that he continued long into the 1660s and even the 1670s, painting ever-weaker versions of his father's work which eventually became mockeries of his father's genius	LA TOUR, Georges de	St Sebastien Attended by St Irene	Oil on canvas, 167 x 130 cm	c. 1649	religious	French	1601-1650
30613-2mira11.jpg	Toward the end of the seventeenth century, Cesare Alessandri, a wealthy Venetian merchant had a wing erected to the side of his villa, to be used as foresteria (guest quarters). Decorations embellish three rooms on the second floor; the paintings in the central hall and in the northwest room are attributed to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini. The fresco cycles in these two rooms constitute the first private fresco commission given to Pellegrini after his return to Venice from Rome. His stay in Rome had been beneficial to his development, enabling him to incorporate into his own visual repertory the language of Luca Giordano and Baciccio.The frescoes that adorn the northwest room, with the scene Hannibal Swearing his Hatred of the Romans, one can detect a certain stiffening of the figures compared to the rendering of those in the central hall. This may be the fault of the faux architecture, which is rather cumbersome, out of proportion	PELLEGRINI, Giovanni Antonio	View of the northwest room in the foresteria	Fresco	c. 1704	interior	Italian	1701-1750
32256-08triump.jpg	The Triumph of Pan was one of several paintings commissioned from Poussin, in 1636 the leading French artist in Rome, by Cardinal Richelieu. They were intended for a room in his ch&#226;teau in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa. Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs. He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling.The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's ch&#226;teau celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas. The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin. Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering décor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting. Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye.Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view. Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus.The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore. The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East. Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus. A world of pagan imaginings is brought to life in all its cruel and seductive charm, without a hint of anachronistic moralising	POUSSIN, Nicolas	The Triumph of Pan	Oil on canvas, 134 x 145 cm	1636	mythological	French	1601-1650
24924-metropo1.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine	MASTER of the Acts of Mercy	Martyrdom of St Lawrence (interior)	Oil on fir panel, 74 x 47 cm	1460s	religious	Austrian	1451-1500
04499-holyfami.jpg	This picture displays several distinctive aspects of Mannerist vocabulary: formal complexity, awkward composition, eclectic style, and vibrant colouring.

06024-6joseph.jpg	This painting has a pendant, Jacob punishing Joseph (private collection)made by Nicolaes de Helt Stockade in the same year, 1655. It is unclear how De Bray and De Helt Stockade came to make pendants; the partnership may have ben brought about by an Amsterdam client.De Brays picture illustrates one of the last episodes of the Old Testament story of Joseph, in which it transpires that his father's interpretation of the dream was correct. The elderly Jacob, who reached the age of 130, took his family to Egypt to see his son Joseph, viceroy to the pharaoh, for the last time in his life. He had sent another son, Judah, to announce the family's arrival. Joseph prepared his chariot at once and set off to meet Jacob in Goshen. On seeing his father he embraced him and wept.In the painting, Jacob's entire family bows down before Joseph, who stands on the right guarded by soldiers with halberds. The chariot in which he rode to meet his father - depicted here as a seventeenth-century carriage - is visible in the background. On the left we see Jacob, his first wife Leah (Rachel, Joseph's mother was no longer alive) and Joseph's brothers. The small dog with the dog in the left foreground could be Jacob's youngest son, Benjamin.The composition of the painting corresponds closely to two drawings, both of which, like the painting, date from 1655.

05488-4predell.jpg	The picture shows the fourth (central) predella panel of the St Barnaba Altarpiece.The Passion of Christ, to which the large main panel also alludes, is the theme of the predella panel. Christ is standing in a stone sarcophagus, displaying his stigmata. In front of him lie the instruments of his Passion, the crown of thorns and nails.

19452-eucharis.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. While Dutch paintings of flowers, particularly tulips, clearly showed a tendency towards secularization (with noticeable emphasis on the economic and aesthetic value of flowers rather than their religious significance, Seghers tried to recover their spiritual symbolism, in accordance with the counter-reformational aims the Jesuit order.Apart from the Virgin Mary, Seghers and his pupils had a preference for Eucharistic motifs. They particularly enjoyed painting arrangements of garlands around a niche in a wall in brown hues, showing a communion chalice with a host suspended above it. The host has a mysterious luminescent quality which emphasized the process of transubtantiation (the changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus). This subject was painted especially frequently by Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who was born in Utrecht but spent a considerable amount of time in Antwerp.Like Seghers, de Heem succeeded in adding a phosphorescent luminosity to his garlands, which also have an enamel-like clarity about them and richly colourful nuances. In his Eucharistic motifs they consist of fruit - particularly grapes - and bundles of grain, as well as apples, pears, figs and maize. The human eye can hardly appreciate the infinitely delicate precision of the tender, thread-like stems and little twigs winding around the jumble of the painstakingly detailed fruits. The Eucharist had a particularly prominent place in the Catholic Counter-Reformation, as a response to the Protestant doctrine that bread and wine merely had a symbolic value during communion	HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de	Eucharist in Fruit Wreath	Oil on canvas, 138 x 125,5 cm	1648	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
03610-72rebel1.jpg	This panel is one of the surviving two predella paintings which belonged to the altarpiece commissioned for the church of San Niccol&#242; al Carmine, Siena. The predella depicted scenes from the legend of St Michael.Most unusually, in these panels Beccafumi has abandoned the oil he used for the altarpiece for the old-fashioned, less flexible medium of tempera.

19786-dianacal.jpg	The mythological subject of this painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself. One of them, Callisto, was seduced by Jupiter who first disguised himself as Diana in order to gain the nymphs presence. In Diana and Callisto, the unfortunate Callisto is shown being stripped by her companions at the command of the chaste goddess Diana to reveal her pregnancy. Banished for her shameful state, Callisto was transformed into a bear by Jupiter's jealous wife Juno, but was later immortalised by him as the constellation of the Great Bear.Hoet's refined technique is visible in his delicate style of painting and bears resemblance to the Leiden fijnschilders of the period. Although the size of the Colnaghi-Bernheimer painting is relatively small, Hoet manages to create a lively interaction between the figures and their setting and the composition is supplemented by Italianate architectural ruins which are visible in the background	HOET, Gerard I	Diana and Callisto	Oil on copper, 35 x 45 cm	c. 1710	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

19311-material.jpg	William Harnett developed the trompe-l'oeil technique in American painting This early work shows the style and technique which made him popular.

The attention to detail with which he captures each object and its textures and reflections is combined with the sense of immediacy and instantaneity conferred by the pipe smoke, the burning matches and the breadcrumbs scattered on the table	HARNETT, William Michael	Materials for a Leisure Hour	Oil on canvas, 38 x 52 cm	1879	still-life	American	1851-1900

We see that Manet's painting seems both more carefully thought out and more ambitious than Renoir's. Manet remains allusive, lacking the spontaneity shown by Renoir.

She refused him and although he kept his word, he denied her perpetual youth, so she was commanded to centuries as a wizened crone.In the painting the Sibyl, a young woman is shown standing before the sitting Apollo holding out her cupped hand which contains the heap of dust	CERRINI, Giovanni Domenico	Apollo and the Cumaean Sibyl	Oil on canvas, 102 x 135 cm	-	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

13335-1open.jpg	"The most famous work of Jan van Eyck is a huge Ghent Altarpiece with many scenes in the city of Ghent. It is said to have been begun by Jan's elder brother Hubert, of whom little is known, and was completed by Jan in 1432. On the frame a quatrain is inscribed which states that the polyptych was begun by Pictor Hubertus Eyck, and finished by his brother Jan, at the request of Jodocus Vijd, deputy burgomaster of Ghent, warden of the church of St John, and of his wife, Elisabeth Borluut, who commissioned it. The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432.The stylistic analysis reveals that in the painting the work of two different hands can be clearly discerned. The overall conception of the altarpiece is the work of Hubert, along with the execution of certain parts, such as the panels in the lower tier. Here, the manner is archaic, and reflects the continuing dominance of the international style that was practised by Broederlam. The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification. When opened, it represents the communion of saints, which is ""the new heaven and the new earth"", in the words of the Revelation of St John. Thus the central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.The community of saints also extends onto the side panels. Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges. Opposite them are the Holy Hermits who have renounced the world, and the Pilgrim Saints, who were favourite figures of identification throughout the Middle Ages. They are led by a giant of a man, St Christopher. Many later commentators have suggested that his great height would have reminded the contemporary viewer of Jodocus Vijd's brother, also called Christopher. In the middle of the upper tier is God Almighty, the Word, essence and origin of the universe. He is dressed in red and is crowned with a magnificent tiara. On his left is Mary and on his right, St John the Baptist. These central figures are surrounded by angels who are singing or playing instruments. At the far right and left of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. They were painted by Jan Van Eyck, and are set into trompe-l'oeil niches. Light and shadow play delicately over their forms which stand out as though they had been sculpted in the round."

21490-s_ursula.jpg	Painted by Lanfranco at the commission of Giacomo Simonelli, this painting decorated Simonelli's family chapel which was dedicated to Saint Ursula. In 1630 the church, Santa Marta in Vaticano, was destroyed to clear space for the construction of the Vatican's Palazzo del Governatorato. A date of 1622 was proposed for the picture on the basis of stylistic analogies with Lanfranco's Saint Margherita of Cortona, signed and dated by the artist in 1622 (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence). The Saint Ursula does not belong to the most refined and elegant phase of Lanfranco's career (1618-20), but rather to a slightly later phase of around 1622-24. This protobaroque period for Lanfranco is characterized by a more robust and vigorous style that is a prelude to the artist's full baroque work of 1624-25.In the same years Lanfranco also carried out another work for the Simonelli family at Santa Marta, an altarpiece similar in typology and style to the Saint Ursula. Showing the Virgin and Child and Saints James and Anthony Abbot, the painting is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna	LANFRANCO, Giovanni	St Ursula and the Virgins	Oil on canvas, 209 x 138	1622	religious	Italian	1601-1650
32783-23connes.jpg	Before his arrival in Florence, Raphael had already had occasion to compose small-scale devotional icons of the Madonna and Child, linked to a taste for the versions created by Perugino. An interesting sequence of this type can be seen in several examples, all from around 1502 to 1504, built on the motif of the Madonna holding a book. They are known as the Solly Madonna (in Berlin), the Norton Simon Madonna (in California) and the Conestabile Madonna (in St. Petersburg).The painting was a gift of the Conestabile family of Perugia to the Russian tzaress in 1871. When transferring to canvas at the end of the last century it was discovered that originally instead of the book there was a pomegranate in the hands of the Madonna. The landscape of the background with snow-capped peaks deserves a particular attention.Raphael met the challenge of creating a round composition when he painted this delicate Madonna. He provides a stable structure for the round picture by means of the vertical figure of the Madonna and the horizontal lines of the landscape. The Madonna's head is gently inclined and the contour of her left hand flows rhythmically into the outline of the Christ Child's body, thus responding to the circular form	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	Madonna with the Book (Conestabile Madonna)	Tempera on canvas transferred from wood, diameter 17,9 cm	1504	religious	Italian	1501-1550
28922-port_sol.jpg	Moroni was one of the most accomplished portraitists in Lombard painting in the 16th century. For a long time he did not obtain the recognition he deserved, because some of his best portraits were attributed to Titian. His teacher was Moretto da Brescia (Alessandro Bonvicino), like-wise a skilled portraitist. There is no documented evidence of Moroni ever having visited Venice, but his oeuvre demonstrates that he was familiar with the work being done there	MORONI, Giovanni Battista	Portrait of a Soldier	Oil on canvas, 119 x 91 cm	1555-59	portrait	Italian	1551-1600

16367-wall.jpg	The decorative bands on the walls above contain several scenes from the Old Testament and busts of saints and prophets. The Old Testament scenes are of a very modest standard, and owe their presence in the chapel to the Gothic tradition of representing parallels between the Old and New Testament. Some of the figures of saints and prophets are of very high workmanship, and among the most impressive of Giotto's repertoire	GIOTTO di Bondone	Scenes with decorative bands	Fresco	1304-06	religious	Italian	1301-1350
27171-i_landsc.jpg	Under Louis XIV, the two main landscape painter of the time were Pierre Patel and Francisque Millet. They were largely derivative in their styles, but this was the secret of their success. Both of them are relatively little known today.Francisque Millet was more talented than Patel, though his present reputation is also obscure. Flemish in origin like Philippe de Champaigne, he worked mainly in Paris, specializing in classical landscapes inspired by the works of Dughet and Poussin. Millet had imagination and good powers of observation, but he never painted anything without a classical format. Millet preferred an intense blue for his landscapes (as did Poussin), which gives then an unnatural air.The ideal landscape in Budapest characterizes well the style of this French painter of Flemish origin	MILLET, Francisque	Imaginary Landscape	Oil on canvas, 57 x 66,5 cm	1660s	landscape	French	1651-1700
15485-1donor.jpg	"""In two pictures on either side he painted Francesco Sassetti kneeling, and Madonna Nera, his wife and her children, the latter being in the scene above where the boy is raised to life, with some beautiful maidens of the same family"" (Vasari).The two donors are in prayer on either side of the altar, as if they are taking part in the Adoration of the Shepherds depicted on the altarpiece. Linking the frescoes and the central panel painting in this way, Ghirlandaio creates what is almost a triptych. Astonishingly enough, the wife, Nera Corsi Sassetti, is occupying the traditionally more distinguished position on the right of the religious scene.At the base is the painted inscription: A.D. MCCCCLXXX. XV decembris. This could be the initial date of the work whose conclusion is in the great altarpiece with the Nativity, dated 1485"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Portrait of the Donor Nera Corsi Sassetti	Fresco	1483-85	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
39646-4vendra.jpg	Returning to Venice from Rome in 1546 Titian created a remarkable group portrait of the male members of the Vendramin. Here he domesticizes official work such as Bellini's votive portrait of Doge Agostino Barbarigo as well as frescoes he had seen in the papal apartments in Rome. While the painting has the look of an impromptu gathering, it is rooted  in prestigious models that betray political motives on the part of Titian and the Vendramin.Titian adapted elements such as the steps, massive altar and flickering candles from Raphael's Mass of Bolsena as a suitably impressive setting for the Vendramin family's adoration of a reliquary of a fragment of the True Cross. Although the relic was owned by the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the Vendramin family was closely associated with it: one of their ancestors had donated the relic to the Scuola, and an Andrea Vendramin, namesake of Titian's patron, was famous for having rescued it when it fell into a canal. Titian suggests the intimacy of the family's relation to the relic by placing the current head of family (also named Andrea) in the centre of the composition, with one hand on the altar as he looks out of the picture, inviting the viewer's participation. At the left two other family members, dressed in senatorial red, pay their eloquent devotion to the relic, the middle-aged man reaching out as if to share his adoration with others. Titian records and contrasts the emotions of his subjects; the sober obedience of the adolescents at left and the innocent play of the children at right serve to underscore the maturity and depth of the adults' piety, as civic, as well as personal virtue.Titian is supposed to have said a painter only needed three colours: white, black and red. Looking at this painting, one may well believe it	TIZIANO Vecellio	The Vendramin Family Venerating a Relic of the True Cross	Oil on canvas, 206 x 289 cm	1540-45	religious	Italian	1501-1550
29959-farminte.jpg	Isaack van Ostade, like his brother Adriaen, depicted peasant and low-life scenes.

14636-coronati.jpg	This is the centre panel of an altarpiece. Two panels depicting four standing saints (Sts Peter, James, Bartholomew, and Anthony Abbot) in Museo Nazionale di San Matteo, Pisa, are suggested to be on the right-hand side, other parts are not identified.The composition of the centre panel follows that of Giotto's Coronation of the Virgin in the Baroncelli Chapel of half century earlier. Nothing appears to have occurred between 1330 and 1380 to render Giotto's prototype out of date: the latter painting reveals no startling new approach. Only the proportions have been elongated in accordance with Gothic ideal of elegance; otherwise the design has been followed faithfully. Where the differences lie is in nuances of colour, and it is these nuances that reveal a Florentine tradition and its development	GADDI, Agnolo	Coronation of the Virgin	Egg tempera on wood, 184 x 94 cm	1380-85	religious	Italian	1351-1400

San Pietro de Castello, the church shown. was the residence of the Republic's Patriarch and of great local importance prior to his move to San Marco.

25111-4portrai.jpg	Although abraded in places, this little portrait proves that the Master of the Legend of St Ursula as a minor master was capable of a high degree of refinement and that he was an exceptionally talented colourist. The dark purple colour of the upper garment against the dark green-blue of the plain background creates a remarkably cool, almost nocturnal effect. The white carnation, which one would normally have expected to be red as the symbol of love, adds to the sober mood. Although there are no traces of hinges, it is not impossible that this little work had a separate man's portrait as its pendant. The meaning of the white carnation is unclear. The lighter halo around the head is probably the result of overcleaning	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Ursula (I)	Portrait of a Lady with a Carnation	Oil on oak panel, 24,5 x 20,3 cm	1480-1500	portrait	Flemish	1451-1500

17258-auvers18.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 789, JH 2006.In this painting the church in Auvers has been transformed by the artist into a vision using form and colour. Painted in portrait format, the church towers up before the onlooker like a fortification. The path leading to it forks in the foreground into two narrow paths passing the church on either side. On the path to the left, her back turned toward us, a peasant woman is walking into the distance. The path is bathed in light, while the church is viewed against the backdrop of a dark blue sky that merges with the black-blue of the night sky at the edges of the picture. The brushwork is restless and full of movement, and the forms of the church are distorted in the Expressionist manner	GOGH, Vincent van	The Church at Auvers	Oil on canvas, 94 x 74 cm	June 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

10397-03adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht Dürer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike Dürer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Adam and Eve	Oil on lime wood panel, 171 x 63 cm (each)	after 1537	religious	German	1501-1550
07921-margaret.jpg	This altarpiece in a chapel in Santa Caterina dei Funari, Rome was commissioned by Gabriele Bombasi, a member of the Farnese entourage. The figure of the saint was taken directly from The Madonna of St Luke (now in the Louvre) which Annibale Carracci had painted for the cathedral in Reggio Emilia in 1592. The figure was copied by Lucio Massari (1569-1633), a pupil of Carracci, and Annibale carried out the finishing touches	CARRACCI, Annibale	St Margaret	Oil on canvas, 239 x 134 cm	1597-99	religious	Italian	1551-1600
08805-autumn.jpg	Autumn landscapes were often painted by Church, who exploited the possibilities autumn gave for brilliant colouring, from the blue sky in the upper left to the intense reds of the leaves.

On the exterior of the wings are Sts Hermolaus, Achatius and his followers on the left, and on the right Sts Cecilia, Genevieve, Helen and Catherine, each with members of the donor's family.

10654-10csont.jpg	"The angular figure of the Saviour is standing in the middle isolated from everything and everybody. He is raising up his hands  as if praying or preaching. The group of the twelve  apostles are looking out of the picture. Dr. Rezsõ Pertorini, author of the Csontváry pathogaph, grouped them as people shouting, ""Crucify him,"" as if they were a choir in a Greek tragedy. Faces are suggestive, those of the Saviour and Moses are expressive.The picture condenses events. Moses is standing with stone tablets on the left. The silhouette of a town can be seen in the background, it is Jerusalem. On the right, there is a slim tree with a block of stone at its foot with two black figures tumbling on it. Behind the tree, there is a modern church which is lit: it can be approached on a steep slope. Next to it, there are three columns with winged sculptures and a domed building on the left. A group of people are approaching the church. The picture has a complicated and symbolic message, in fact, the painter attempted to sum up the history of christianity. He portrayed the Old Testament on the left and the New Testament on the right: the former  being represented by Moses and the tables of the Testament, and the New Testament by Jesus' sermon, payer, and desciples, the tree symbolizing the cross, and the mourners with a stone suggesting a grave.There are symbolic objects and scenes on both sides. The  background stretches out to the distance. Thus, the painter emphasizes the main characters. The composition is balanced. The connection between time and space, and the suggestivity of tools with expressive power are in  harmony with one another"	CSONTVÁRY KOSZTKA, Tivadar	Praying Saviour	Oil on canvas, 100 x 82 cm	1903	religious	Hungarian	1851-1900
05673-adoratio.jpg	Boucher had never been a committed artistic believer. Although he had worked in Italy, the Italian tradition did not tempt him into vast imaginative schemes. He never aimed at a heroic vision. He expressed no glorious promises about heaven: either as an Olympian refuge for aristocratic families, or in ordinary Christian terms. Like most French eighteenth-century painters, he could not evolve a satisfactory idiom for religious pictures of any kind; and he was particularly unsuited to the task by the nature of his real abilities.The picture shows one of his rare paintings of religious subject	BOUCHER, François	Adoration of the Shepherds	Oil on canvas	1750	religious	French	1701-1750
41328-040madon.jpg	This panel, showing Mary as Queen of Heaven, was probably originally the centre of a triptych or tabernacle.In Italy, with its profound piety, images of Christ and the Virgin Mary were found early on, in contrast to northern Europe. Altarpieces such as the Lucca Madonna were already common in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This cult image is strongly traditional and yet has elements of content and form that anticipate future developments	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Madonna Enthroned with the Christ Child	Canvas laid over poplar, 104 x 63 cm	c. 1260	religious	Italian	1251-1300
28916-contarin.jpg	The reputation of Moroni of Bergamo rests primarily on his numerous portraits although, like his master, Moretto da Brescia, he also painted altarpieces and religious compositions. His models were, for the most part, the patricians, bourgeois scholars and artisans living in the small towns of Northern Italy. Usually he painted them at work with the tools of their particular trade: the scholar is seen holding a book or writing implements, the tailor is about to cut his cloth.According to a later inscription at the top right, this is a portrait of Jacopo Contarini, Podesta of Padua. However, Padua never had a Podesta of this name and, since it is known that Jacopo Foscarini filled that office when the picture was painted, we can only assume that the inscription is inaccurate and that the portrait is indeed of Foscarini. He is shown as a distinguished man of middle age with an air of seriousness that commands respect. Only the serene harmony of greys and reds resolves the sombre mood of the painting	MORONI, Giovanni Battista	Portrait of Jacopo Foscarini	Oil on canvas, 105 x 84 cm	1575	portrait	Italian	1551-1600

15654-dead_chr.jpg	The Incarnation of Christ and his death are depicted in this panel, which is divided into two sectors, one above the other.The deceased Christ is portrayed in half length with his arms crossed on his chest. His head is tilted to one side and his eyes are closed, with a cross on his halo and the stigmata clearly visible on his hands and ribs. Two angels at his sides are richly embellished with diadems and halos on their heads and with capes and wings. They also have their arms crossed like Christ, a gesture that expresses resignation for the unavoidable divine sacrifice.In the lower sector, the infant Jesus is lying on the ground, barely covered by a transparent cloth; his small body emits strong rays of light. Two angels kneel behind him with their hands clasped together. They wear diadems and have halos above their heads. The Madonna, with her arms crossed on her chest, and Saint Joseph, with his hands clasped together in adoration, are kneeling before the child	GHISSI, Francescuccio	The Dead Christ and the Adoration of the Infant Jesus	Tempera and gold on wood, 39 x 29 cm	after 1373	religious	Italian	1351-1400
43793-18actors.jpg	Until the end of the seventeenth century the theater of the great tragic playwrights and of Molière inspired painters little or not at all, apart from illustrated editions. Change occurred when Claude Gillot and his pupil Antoine Watteau drew a great deal on 'commedia del'arte' characters, which had been familiar to the French public for a century, though mainly on a burlesque level. The Italian Commedia dell'Arte troupe, which had been banned in 1697, was reestablished in 1716.

05308-31right.jpg	The right wing represents St Anthony in Meditation.The powerful evocation of a corrupt and stinking world is no less apparent in the right wing, where Bosch used as his starting point the story of the Devil-Queen, a subject he had already depicted in the Hermit Saints altarpiece. The Devil-Queen appears in the river before Anthony, shielding her private parts with a false modesty and surrounded by her infernal court. Anthony averts his eyes from this obscene group only to be summoned by a demon-herald to the devilish feast in the foreground. The open-air table, the cloth slung tent-like over the tree stump beside the temptress, and the servants pouring wine seem like a grotesque parody of the traditional Garden of Love. In the background looms the city of the Devil-Queen, its demonic nature betrayed by the dragon swimming in the moat and by the flames erupting from the top of the main gate	BOSCH, Hieronymus	Triptych of Temptation of St Anthony (right wing)	Oil on panel, 131,5 x 53 cm	1505-06	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

42128-09casafl.jpg	This fresco is part of the paintings decorating the house of Vasari in Florence.It is characteristic of Vasari's self-confidence that the artistic and intellectual effort he invested in designing his own home was comparable to that which he expended on the residences of those who commissioned his work. He decorated his house in Arezzo between 1542 and 1548; toward the end of his life he also frescoed his Florentine house, which had been given to him by Duke Cosimo I in 1561. In both cases the paintings refer to the role of the painter, who saw himself in the tradition of ancient painters (to whom individual episodes of both cycles are devoted)	VASARI, Giorgio	The Studio of the Painter	Fresco	c. 1563	genre	Italian	1551-1600
34263-gregory.jpg	"Ricci was an exuberant personality, internationally renowned and an archetypal ""traveling"" painter. After training in the Veneto, Ricci spent some time in Emilia (Bologna, Parma and Piacenza). This proved crucial to his development as his style was influenced by the local classicism, deepened when Ricci made a trip to Rome, where Annibale Carraci's frescos in Palazzo Farnese deeply moved him. After a brief trip to Vienna, Ricci went back to Venice in 1708, where his art changed. His Altarpiece of St Gregory the Great was a deliberate homage to Paolo Veronese and inaugurated a totally new era in eighteenth-century Venetian painting, trying to revive the glories of its Renaissance. Compared to his earlier works, his art was now remarkably free in composition and brushwork. This new style of painting was an immediate success. By 1711 Sebastiano had joined his nephew Marco Ricci in London where he remained for five years, working for many great noblemen."

42738-mazeppa1.jpg	Vernet's oil study Mazeppa of 1826, done in advance of the large painting in the Musée Calvet in Avignon, was based on a theme from Lord Byron's verse epic of the same name, which was translated into French soon after its publication in 1819. The story relates how Mazeppa, a Cossack chief, made illicit advances to the daughter of a Polish prince. As punishment, he was tied naked to the back of a wild horse, which galloped off with him. Exhausted to the point of death, he was finally saved by a Cossack girl.Mazeppa not only represents a man whose animal instincts caused him to be subjected to an animal fate; he also embodies the outcast and pariah who is condemned by society. In this regard, Mazeppa could figure as a romantic symbol of artistic self-reliance and determination	VERNET, Horace	Mazeppa	Oil on canvas, 33 x 41 cm	1826	other	French	1801-1850
21551-rousseau.jpg	Jean-Baptiste Rousseau (1671-1741) was a French dramatist and poet who enjoyed great popularity in the witty and decadent Parisian society of his day.

44528-federi06.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Zandomeneghi settled in Paris in 1874, living a reclusive life, and, unsuccessful in his lifetime, was obliged to earn a living doing fashion drawings. He exhibited in the 1879, 1881, and 1886 Impressionist exhibitions. In street scenes such as Place d'Anvers, Paris his brushwork was relaxed and sketchy	ZANDOMENEGHI, Federico	Place d'Anvers, Paris	Oil on canvas, 100 x 135 cm	1880	landscape	Italian	1851-1900
43679-viewdel1.jpg	In this heraldic composition Vroom presents a wide-angle view of Delft from west-southwest. The massive Sint Jorispoort commands the centre of the view; the three most prominent towers are those of, from left to right, the Oude Kerk, the Stadhuis, and the Nieuwe Kerk. This canvas, signed and dated lower centre, on wall of inn, is one of the earliest known cityscape paintings.

39072-6forest1.jpg	Giambattista chose to decorate only one of the rooms in the foresteria at the Villa Valmarana. In the so-called Olympus Room he frescoed Mars, Venus and Amor; Mercury; Time; Jupiter; and Apollo and Diana. This last fresco shows the two deities sitting on a cloud. Apollo, who faces the viewer, holds his lyre in his right hand and his quiver of arrows in his left, while Diana, partly concealed and with her back to the viewer, reclines to his right. Apollo's golden yellow robe and the yellowish colour of the clouds are meant to allude to his office as Sun God	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	Apollo and Diana	Fresco, 200 x 185 cm	1757	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
04468-market_s.jpg	The painter depicts objects in every-day use, primarily tools, kitchen appliances and dishes made of diverse materials, which correspond in every detail to the equipment used at the time. The costumes of the figures mirror the clothes worn at the time by Dutch market women and country folk.This painting shows three people: a man edges closer to the younger of two market women, apparently with an unequivocal proposition. The two are surrounded by the goods for sale, such as butter, cheese, eggs and poultry in baskets, barrels and on wooden cheese plates. The goods displayed in such abundance in Beuckelaer's painting bear a metaphorical message which is erotic rather than religious. They are perceived as aphrodisiacs or used colloquially as synonyms for sexual feelings and practices	BEUCKELAER, Joachim	Market Scene	Oil on oak, 111 x 164 cm	1563	genre	Flemish	1551-1600
15892-certosa3.jpg	The new treasury (Tesoro Nuovo) was built on the north side of the monastery. Its painted decoration, completed in 1704 by the elderly Luca Giordano, constituted the last phase of the decoration of the charterhouse.Giordano painted Judith in Triumph over Holofernes on the cupola vault. The figure that appears to dominate the vault is the heroic Judith triumphantly displaying the head of Holofernes to the people of Israel. The lunettes contains scenes from the Old Testament, among them Aaron's Sacrifice, and the Destruction of the Band of Korah above the entrance, and the Erection of the Brazen Serpent above the altar	GIORDANO, Luca	Aaron's Sacrifice, and the Destruction of the Band of Korah	Fresco	1703-04	religious	Italian	1651-1700

09537-lastjudg.jpg	In Munich in 1836 Cornelius received a major commission to decorate the altar wall of the Ludwigskirche with the fresco of the Last Judgment. Basically it is oriented to Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel, but is easily half as big again, so it is now the largest fresco in the world. It proved fatal for Cornelius. The individual elements simply would not resolve into a unified composition. Cornelius was overwhelmed with criticism as soon as the painting was finished, and there were acrimonious disputes with King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

35423-43religi.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. However, this can be traced back to Rubens's Madonna in Floral Wreath (with the collaboration of Jan Brueghel the Elder). This represents a picture within a picture with an authoritative religious significance, encircled by a floral arrangement and cherubs. Unlike Seghers, however, Rubens did not quote Mary and Jesus as historical traditions or pictorial relics. Instead he preferred to give the impression that they were physically present, even though the motif of a picture within a picture would have been ideally suited for illusionist stylization.This painting is a good example of the encounter of talents of Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder, one much appreciated by collectors. Each exhibits his own virtuosity, Rubens painting the figures and Brueghel the floral decoration	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Madonna in Floral Wreath	Oil on oak, 185 x 209,8 cm	c. 1620	religious	Flemish	1601-1650

08065-strawbo1.jpg	Carrier-Belleuse's portraits of women are few, and for them he often worked in a neo-Rococo mode, participating in the eighteenth-century revival that began and flourished in the mid-nineteenth century. The identity of the sitter of the present bust is unknown. The women Carrier-Belleuse portrayed were generally actresses or singers, wives or daughters of friends, and high society ladies, whose identities were discreetly concealed	CARRIER-BELLEUSE, Albert-Ernest	Girl in a Straw Bonnet	Terracotta, height 92 cm	1868-70	portrait	French	1851-1900
02504-6elem1.jpg	This painting is identifiable with a picture of Air by Arcimboldo. It is a copy after Arcimboldo's painting, or perhaps a workshop version from a later series of elements, or perhaps a repetition made for the emperor.Like Earth and probably Water in the series, Air is also based on studies from nature. Many of the birds whose heads are seen in this composite were drawn by Arcimboldo, along with many other avian species. However, because they are crowded together, the individual species represented here are harder to identify	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Air	Oil on canvas, 74 x 56 cm	c. 1566	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
31749-12figure.jpg	In spring 1884 Pissarro settled in Eragny on the River Epte, where he, his wife, and their six children remained for the rest of their life.

40447-calvary.jpg	Ugolino Lorenzetti (or Ugolino-Lorenzetti) is an invented name for an unknown artist midway between the styles of Ugolino da Siena and the Lorenzetti. Also known as the Ovile Master (Maestro di San Pietro Ovile), he has been tentatively identified with Bartolommeo Bulgarini (active c. 1347-d. 1378) who is known to have been a painter.The altarpiece displays features that derive from Byzantine artistic tradition: the depiction of figures on different scales, the placement of the groups, and architecture shown from several viewpoints simultaneously	UGOLINO-LORENZETTI	Calvary	Tempera on panel, 92 x 56 cm	1340-60	religious	Italian	1301-1350
25210-0_virgin.jpg	This painting, depicting the Virgin seated among four female martyrs, was probably painted for a nunnery. The painter very subtly included the saints' attributes as ornaments on chains around their neck. On the left is Catherine with the wheel on which she was tortured. Cecilia, behind her, has her organ, Barbara her tower, and Ursula is adorned with the arrow that pierced her heart.A number of late 15th-century  works were grouped around this picture at the beginning of the 20th century, and the artist was christened the Master of the Virgo inter Virgines after this painting	MASTER of the Virgo inter Virgines	Virgin and Child with Sts Catherine, Cecilia, Barbara, and Ursula	Oil on panel, 123 x 102 cm	c. 1490	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

43001-4finding.jpg	This small painting, which probably came from the collection of Charles I of England, is one of the earliest and best versions of an Old Testament subject inspired by the works of the painter Bonifazio de'Pitati. Several replicas in Veronese's own hand are known, together with a number of variants and sundry derivations carried out with the help of the workshop.The scene is a river bank in a highly atmospheric landscape. The story tells of an infant boy left out in a basket on the Nile, who is found by Pharaohs daughter and brought up by her as her own son, Moses. The bridge and city are reminiscent of Verona. The delicately nuanced interplay of light and shade, achieved with a fine brush, unfolds to produce the glowing effect of brilliant jewels	VERONESE, Paolo	The Finding of Moses	Oil on canvas, 50 x 30 cm	c. 1580	religious	Italian	1551-1600
34347-talmont.jpg	The painting depicts the death of Charles de la Trémoille, Prince of Talmont and Mortagne after the battle of Marignano in 1515.

32334-02ignazi.jpg	"This spectacular composition is almost an inventory of Baroque architectural ceilings and their final triumph. According to Jesuit ideas, the space within a church was a single area in which the faithful congregated. In Sant'Ignazio space is stretched (Pozzo was clever at the illusion of ""doubling"" the perspective of the real architecture) before exploding into light and glory. Saints, angels, allegories, and floating clouds accentuate the virtuoso effect. The impression is one of exuberance and freedom. In reality, it was worked out using scientific criteria.Designed to be viewed from a point in the centre of the nave, which is marked by a white stone, Padre Pozzo's ceiling produces the illusion of a palace opening on the sky."

34931-11berze.jpg	There are wonderful wall paintings in the Cluniac chapel of Ch&#226;teau des Moines at Berzé-la-Ville, near Cluny. The chapel contains the tomb of Abbot Hugh of Cluny (1049-1109) who designed the programme of the mural paintings of highly peculiar iconography. These paintings represent the best surviving examples of the art of Cluny.In the apse, Christ is enthroned as omnipotent ruler of the world.

14348-jesusdoc.jpg	Following the restoration of Spanish rule and Catholic worship in Antwerp in 1585, the city fathers ordered the crafts and guilds to reinstall their altars in the Cathedral. Among the first to respond were the Schoolmasters and the Soap-boilers, who shared an altar in the church. They contracted Frans Francken to paint a triptych showing Jesus among the Doctors. (The left wing depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine, while the right wing the Miracle of the Flowing Oil.)The scenes plainly have most to do with the schoolmasters. The centre panel shows the episode from St Luke's Gospel in which the twelve-year-old Jesus debates theology with the Jewish scribes in the Temple at Jerusalem. His parents, who have found him after a long search, look somewhat dejected. The Temple is represented by a Renaissance church interior with a menorah and the Ark of the Covenant in the background.The left wing shows Ambrose, the patron saint of Antwerp's schoolmasters, baptising St Augustine in the presence of a canon-scholaster and several council members from the Schoolmasters' Guild. The only reference to the Soap-boilers is in the right wing, where the Bible story of the Miracle of the Flowing Oil is depicted. The prophet Elisha helped the widow of Zarephath out of debt by causing her oil jug to continuously replenish itself - an appropriate theme, for oil was one of the ingredients used by the soap-boilers.The style of the triptych is sober and didactic, as befits the schoolmasters, if not the soapmakers. The balanced composition with its symmetrically arranged groups and the restrained presentation of the principal theme, without many secondary scenes or symbols, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, the latest artistic trend at the time	FRANCKEN, Frans I	Jesus among the Doctors	Oil on wood, 250 x 220 cm (centre panel), 250 x 97 cm (wings)	1587	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
14913-1ponta01.jpg	Gauguin met Charles Laval (1862-1894) at Pont-Aven in the summer of 1886 and the younger artist became his pupil. The two were to journey to Panama and Martinique together the following year. Gauguin's role as mentor is alluded to in the way in which Laval gazes fixedly at the ceramic pot which was made by Gauguin in the winter of 1886-87, when he worked in Paris with the ceramicist Chaplet.The still-life with its piled up fruits, treated with tight diagonal brushstrokes and laid out on a white cloth, is reminiscent of Cézanne's painting Still-Life with Compotier which Gauguin owned at this date. At the same time, the oddly truncated head in the foreground is a homage to Degas, who had exhibited with Gauguin at the final Impressionist exhibition that year	GAUGUIN, Paul	Still-Life with Portrait of Laval	Oil on canvas, 46 x 38 cm	1886	still-life	French	1851-1900

39772-01bluesl.jpg	The biographer Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Titian, describes a similar portrait which he says could easily have been mistaken for a Giorgione if Titian had not signed it. This portrait was erroneously identified by early critics as the portrait of Ariosto; it is perhaps a likeness of Titian's earliest patron, a member of the noble Barbarigo family. In his early period, Titian's portraits are strongly realistic. The painting in its gripping tonal palpability and attention to detail, such as the stitching in the satin, has much in common with Giorgione's late portraits. But Titian, somewhat competitively, carries Giorgione's realism a step further in the way the sleeve billows out and invades our space, extending the boundaries of Giorgionismo in a burst of hyperrealism. The sitter's expression is arrogant, typical of the male dandy. The figure stands out in bold relief against the plain background and the colour emphasizes the unusual lighting, revealing the mood of the sitter as well as capturing his physical presence	TIZIANO Vecellio	Man with the Blue Sleeve	Oil on canvas, 85 x 70 cm	c. 1510	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

40883-05portra.jpg	The young man is placed against a plain red background. Clothing and Italian hairstyle are related to some of Memling's portraits of the 1480s. The hands, too, which only stick out over the frame with the tops of the fingers, are inspired by Memling.Formerly it was considered to be an early Memling, but today the portrait is no longer accepted as an autograph work. The disproportion between head and body and the lack of fine detail suggest a minor master. In the stiff tubular fingers and heavy thumb there is a hint of the manner of the Lucy Master. Moreover, the powerful features and the rough, somewhat vulgar expression with widely separated eyes also seem to fit this master's typology	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Portrait of a Young Man at Prayer	Oil on oak panel, 30,5 x 21,5 cm	1480s	portrait	Flemish	1451-1500

35439-71religi.jpg	Although Rubens run a large workshop, he was perfectly honest about his proceedings. Studio works were rigorously distinguished from those to which he had, to a greater or lesser extent, contributed. Philip IV of Spain wanted works by Rubens, and he wanted them in quantity; Rubens himself supplied them, and no assistants were permitted to help him.

20194-oudekerk.jpg	In this scene set around the pulpit in the Oude Kerks's nave, Houckgeest departs from his main interest in the works of 1650-51 which are concerned with the Delft churches themselves and their most important tomb monuments. Here the principal points of interest include the casual encounter of a man and woman in the foreground, the illusionistic curtain and wood frame; the picturesque sunlight streaming through crystalline air; the coral colour of the column bases, of the brick arches in the transept, and of figures in the stained-glass.The painting is signed in monogram and dated centre bottom on the fictive frame, in foreshortening: GH 165(1)	HOUCKGEEST, Gerard	Interior of the Oude Kerk, Delft, with the Pulpit of 1548	Oil on panel, 49 x 41 cm	1651	interior	Dutch	1601-1650

40732-13icon.jpg	"The central idea of this image, whose eastern Christian iconography can be traced back to the high middle ages, consists in the representation of the Savior's triumph over death and over the evil forces of Satan, as celebrated in the Easter troparion of the Byzantine liturgy: ""Christ is risen from the dead, by his death he has vanquished death, and to those who were in their tombs he has given life.""The present icon represents, at the centre, Christ in glory, resplendent in a burst of golden light. He is placed within an azure mandorla, graduated in tone and hatched with golden rays. Treading upon the gates of hell, which have been thrown off their hinges and flung to the ground, Christ is flanked by two groups of personages: they are the Just of the Old Covenant, prominent among whom are the figures of King David (with the crown), Moses, and Saint John the Baptist. In the persons of Adam and Eve, rising from their tombs in the form of sarcophagi, the whole of humanity is here being won and redeemed.Based on its characteristics this icon may be related to the Byzantine school of Veliko Tarnova of the late seventeenth century"	UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Bulgarian	The Resurrection of Christ	Tempera on linen and wood, 24 x 18 cm	1675-1700	religious	Other	1651-1700

15524-1expuls.jpg	The narration of the story of Mary on the left wall of the chapel starts at the bottom at the entrance to the chapel with the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple.In the centre of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan, a high priest is receiving sacrificial lambs at the altar where a fire is burning. As the old Joachim does not yet have any descendants, he is not allowed to take part in the sacrificial rite, and is sent away. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family.This episode follows the traditional lines of composition. Of significance here is the architecture, which the artist obviously felt was more important than the events. In the upper half of the painting it takes up more space than the figures, who occupy only the bottom part of the picture. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. All the other scenes follow this basic principle.In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi. Interestingly enough, there is a repetition of this façade, constructed shortly after Ghirlandaio's frescoes were painted, that can be seen when leaving the church of Santa Maria Novella at the other end of the piazza by the Spedale di San Paolo (built 1489 -1498).Above the portraits are two palaces whose lines run parallel with those of the temple. Comparable buildings, with rusticated lower stories and open upper stories, largely characterize the appearance of Florence to this day. This was one way in which Ghirlandaio repeatedly brought the city into his paintings.Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants. It is thought that the noblemen on the left include the client's son, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and his friend Piero, the son of Lorenzo de' Medici. In the group at the right Ghirlandaio depicts famous contemporary artists (including himself) who can be identified from the description of Vasari as Alesso Baldovinetti, Bastiano Mainardi, Davide and Domenico Ghirlandaio.

42271-0606vela.jpg	In a manner that is always striking and sometimes curiously moving to modern observers, Velázquez shows human nature in all its diversity when he presents the gallery of dwarfs and jesters who lived at court and whose task it was to preserve the king from boredom in the midst of routine etiquette.Under cover of joking, the court jesters or buffoons, in Spanish truhanes, would often tell their lords and masters the home truths openly discussed by the ordinary people. They could move freely in the king's presence, trying to amuse the naturally melancholic Philip IV with their caustic remarks. To judge by their salaries, their position in society was quite high. Velázquez himself, on entering the service of the palace as a court painter, had at first been classed with the royal servants, and as a result shared the life of these truhanes.Velázquez painted a masterly picture of the buffoon Don Cristóbal de Casta&#241;eda y Pernia, who was first in rank among the court jesters. He gave himself airs as a great military expert, thus earning the nickname of Barbarroja (Barbarossa or Red-beard). The ambitious buffoon aspired to military roles and he even acted as toreador in the arena although he was ill-fitted for doing it. His red robe is almost Turkish in style, and his head-dress suggests a fool's cap. He glares fiercely into space, and while he grips the sheath of his sword firmly, the sword itself is held in a relaxed position	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	The Buffoon Don Cristóbal de Casta?eda y Pernia (Barbarroja)	Oil on canvas, 200 x 121 cm	1637-40	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650
22355-old_man4.jpg	The painting depicts the head and shoulders of an old bearded man. The fanciful studies from life, often exotically costumed, that Lievens, Rembrandt, and their followers painted in large numbers are not portraits as such and are known as tronies, the term for them that was in use at least by 1630.

44513-landsc_r.jpg	In the 1740s the rustic scenes of Zais acquire a simplicity and sincerity more like the pastoral scenes of Zuccarelli with their more light-hearted themes and softer colour. Landscape with River and Bridge is a fine example of the balance of colour and atmosphere achieved by Zais in his works of this period. Here the traditional composition and classical composure of this carefully staged landscape are enlivened by a rustic element, as is often the case in the works of Zais	ZAIS, Giuseppe	Landscape with River and Bridge	Oil on canvas, 97 x 143 cm	c. 1740	landscape	Italian	1701-1750
37293-32madonn.jpg	The two Madonnas in the Siena Pinacoteca, one from Castiglione d'Orcia and the other from Lucignano d'Arbia, are clearly related and must date from more or less the same period. But we have no dates, no signatures and no documents containing any information at all regarding the dating of these works: stylistic analysis is the only element that critics have been able to use. This justifies the widely varying opinions that have been expressed on the subject: some scholars believe that they are totally autograph, while others think that Simone is responsible only for the drawings or for certain sections of the painting, while others still consider them entirely the work of the workshop assistants.Nonetheless, there are many analogies between the various paintings from this period, such as for example, the features of the Madonna in the San Domenico Polyptych, with her gentle and slightly dreaming eyes, repeated almost exactly in the Madonna in the Orvieto Polyptych; or the lively pose of the Child in the panel from Castiglione d'Orcia which is exactly the same as that of the Child in the Boston painting	SIMONE MARTINI	Madonna and Child (from Castiglione d'Orcia)	Tempera on wood	1320-25	religious	Italian	1301-1350
18467-dubarry.jpg	Born to humble beginnings as the daughter of a seamstress, the Comtesse du Barry (1746-1793), née Marie Jeanne Bécu, rose to become one of the most famous figures in the court of Louis XV. Her influence was born out of her legendary powers of seduction, which she used to gain the title of Ma&#238;tresse-en-titre (chief mistress of the King of France), the last to fill the position in the court of Louis XV.Madame du Barry's support for the arts was also legendary, and she came to amass one of the great collections in France in the 18th century. She had her portrait painted by some of the leading artists of the day, including Louise Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, François-Hubert Drouais, and Jean-Baptiste Greuze	GREUZE, Jean-Baptiste	Portrait of the Comtesse du Barry	Oil on canvas, 60 x 48 cm	c. 1771	portrait	French	1751-1800
40232-s_luca_2.jpg	There are seven paintings of Tura of dimension very similar which certainly belonged to one or two polyptychs. Two lost altarpieces can be taken into account: one in San Luca in Borgo at Ferrara and another in San Giacomo at Argenta. There are several proposals of the reconstruction of these altarpieces. According to one suggestions the San Luca polyptych probably had the Madonna (presently in Bergamo) in the centre, St Anthony of Padua (presently in the Musée du Louvre, Paris), St Dominic, St Sebastian (presently in Berlin), St Christopher (presently in Berlin) on the side panels	TURA, Cosm?

29493-drawingl.jpg	Van der Neer's first pictures date to the 1660s, the decade in which Dou, Frans van Mieris, Gerard Terborch, and Gabriel Metsu were at the height of their careers, working in a flourishing market awash with disposable income. Van der Neer's paintings from this early period, among them his Lady Drawing of about 1665, clearly resembles these masters' works. Its subject can be linked to a work by Metsu while the lady's shimmering satin attire and the overall, serene ambience of the panel strongly recall paintings by Terborch.The Lady Drawing is probably not meant to represent a professional woman artist at work but rather a female member of the upper classes practicing drawing. Daughters of elite families were sometimes taught the rudiments of art (which could encompass drawing, painting, or even calligraphy), along with music and poetry in order to enhance their standing in society, particularly among respectable suitors	NEER, Eglon van der	A Lady Drawing	Oil on panel, 30 x 26 cm	c. 1665	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
04069-vastato.jpg	The picture shows the choir vault and apse with illusionistic architecture and scenes from the life of the Virgin (Annunciation, Assumption).The most important setting for the fictive dissolution of ceilings and walls with painting intended to evoke and illustrate heavenly sphere was the church, with its choir tribunes, inner façades, vaults and cupolas. The new type of the hall church evolved following the prototype of the Il Ges&#249; in Rome, and offered fresco painters an ideal space to work in. The vaulted, single-aisle nave flanked by chapels, transepts flooded by light from the centre cupola, and a spacious choir made possible a sophisticated structuring of the pictorial program in conformity with the architecture.The painterly redecoration of the church of Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa following its modernization in the style of the Counter-Reformation began around 1625 with the vaults of the aisles.  The painting of the choir by Giulio Benso began in 1635, and there are staged the most important events of the life of the Virgin as a theatrical spectacle. The Annunciation to the Virgin, central to the church's iconography, takes place in the vault, shifted to heavenly spheres with the help of quadratura. The drama of the Annunciation - Mary receives the angel's message in an airy loggia, while God floats down in glory above her - is then outdone by the ecstasy of the choir calotte's Assumption.This theatrical staging is considered one of the most successful combinations, with respect to foreshortening of quadratura and figural painting with the actual architecture	BENSO, Giulio	Choir vault and apse decoration	Fresco	1637-38	religious	Italian	1601-1650

00221-oratory.jpg	The oratory at the west edge of the city centre of Urbino was erected c. 1393. Nothing is known about the commissioning of the paintings on the walls, a cycle depicting scenes from the life of St John the Baptist. The unidentified patron was probably from Rome from where the Salimbeni brothers, Lorenzo and Jacopo, came to Urbino for this commission. Stylistic analysis tells us that another painter was also engaged for the wall frescoes in the oratory. Antonio Alberti was responsible for the scenes from the St John cycle on the left-hand wall and on the inner façade.The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle in the upper register. The scenic compartments are considered to be the work of Antonio Alberti.The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints were painted by the Salimbeni brothers.	ALBERTI, Antonio	St John fresco cycle	Fresco	c. 1416	religious	Italian	1401-1450

Cowper-Temple at Broadland, later Baron Mount-Temple, 1871; art gallery Thos. Agnew, London, 1888. Acquired by the Earl Iveagh, 1889.An old copy, canvas, 48,7 x 41,2 cm, is in the Museum of Art, Philadelphia. The only difference separating this copy from the Kenwood, London, version is the coiffure of the guitar player, whose style points toward c. 1700. It would be interesting to clean this painting and possibly ascertain, by X-rays, whether the original coiffure is still extant and was overpainted at a later date. Otherwise, both paintings are almost equal as far as pictorial quality is concerned.Together with the Lacemaker (Louvre, Paris), this painting constitutes one of the best achievements by Vermeer, and certainly a towering success in his late maturity. By now, the artist had attained the mastery of light and colours, together with complete freedom of expressing himself technically by means of looser brushstrokes that are no longer bound to specifics of texture or materials. The model is not drawn inward but looks to the outside world in full communication and radiance of her pleasure simply to make music. Never was Vermeer more able to liberate himself from all constraints and convey his artistic viewpoint in a more masterly manner.

04474-v_market.jpg	Joachim Beuckelaer took the market and kitchen painting created by Pieter Aertsen, and developed them into an independent genre which remained popular until well into the 17th century. The didactic element of Beuckelaer's paintings did not manifest itself in propaganda on behalf of Catholic orthodoxy, but in the cheerful censure of the wickedness of worldly pleasure. His paintings are full of allusions to sensuality, sexuality and fertility, with vegetables, fruit, fish, meat and cooking utensils piled up around a few figures. In his best works, Beuckelaer mixes a strong sense of space and detail on the one hand, with unity of composition on the other	BEUCKELAER, Joachim	The Vegetable Market	Oil on panel 149 x 215 cm	1567	still-life	Flemish	1551-1600
23184-21monaco.jpg	There are four panels in the Metropolitan Museum in New York representing Old Testament patriarchs, which are among the finest works of Lorenzo Monaco, who, at the time the panels were painted, was the leading master in Florence. The four patriarchs (Abraham, Noah, Moses, and David) are each portrayed seated on a cut stone bench or chest set on a fictive marble dais, which is alternately pink with a strip of green in the foreground (Noah and David) or green with a strip of violet in the foreground (Abraham and Moses).Abraham wears a pink tunic with green shadows, a violet cloak with pink highlights, and a white shawl draped over his shoulders. He holds a silver sword and a firebrand in his right hand and lays his left on the head of his son, Isaac, kneeling in profile before him, dressed in an orange tunic over a gray robe.The function of these four paintings, possibly as flanking elements of an altarpiece, has been debated	LORENZO Monaco	Abraham	Tempera on panel, 66 x 43 cm	1408-10	religious	Italian	1401-1450

30981-catherin.jpg	"The painting, once attributed by Berenson to Piero, was originally a round panel. Traces of the former round edge are visible in the bottom corners, though the picture was later adapted to fit a rectangular frame. The panel is cryptically signed with the initials ""C P L F"", which was correctly understood to mean ""Calistus de Platea Laudendis fecit"". Dated to between the late 1530's and early 1540's, this picture shows the influence of Lombard and Leonardesque currents, which Callisto unites with references to the art of Raphael's Florentine period. The Florentine influences are particularly notable considering that Callisto's city of Lodi was a centre of Lombard painting at the time."

26100-26vani11.jpg	The picture shows one of the panels of the Triptych of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation which is made up of three panels, all three of which are painted on both sides. This reversible painting would seem to have been intended for use as an aid to private meditation. When the panels are folded slightly inwards, the triptych will stand unsupported - for example, on a table. Its symbolism centres on the opposition between Good and Evil.

40897-08portra.jpg	Few of the worldly paintings of the 15th century have survived intact. An interesting example of this type of painting is the double portrait by an unknown master referred to as the Master of Frankfurt. Despite his misleading title, the artist in question was an anonymous master working in Antwerp. His Portrait of the Artist and his Wife is one of the first profane double portraits in the art of the Southern Netherlands. All that now survives is the centrepiece of what was originally a triptych, which is evident from the shape of the panel and the traces of hinges which are still visible.

18765-guard307.jpg	The division between quay and water and the human activity around the market stalls and gondolas make up the theme of this view of the Molo. The quay, which is provided with steps and jetties for mooring boats, creates a striking line in the composition running almost at a right angle to the lower edge of the image and leads the eye toward a vanishing point just below the middle of the painting. Depicted at the right is the column of Todaro beyond which the buildings along the Molo continue with the Library, the Zecca and the State Grain Storage Houses all the way to the Fonteghetto della Farina near the entrance of the Grand Canal. A market with simple stalls and awnings occupies the Fondaco del Grano. To the left of the entrance of the Grand Canal can be seen the Punta della Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute and in the distance, to the extreme left, the Redentore. The composition is closed off at this end by a fishing boat which counterbalances the column of Todaro. As several corrections by the painter, visible to the naked eye reveal, Guardi modified the strong perspective of the buildings at the right and moved the Salute closer to the centre of the composition.The view of the Molo in the direction of the entrance to the Grand Canal was a subject frequently depicted in Venetian vedute painting. Initially the view functioned primarily as a setting for festive entries in the Doges' Palace, such as in Luca Carlevaris's Reception of Cardinal Cesar d'Estrees (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Later the view of the Molo was usually shown without the Doges' Palace and without any kind of festivity.For this painting, Guardi undoubtedly drew inspiration from a work by Canaletto (c. 1740, private collection) which he may have known through a print by Antonio Visentini from 1742. Not only did Guardi rely on this for his composition, he also borrowed several details from Canaletto such as the little stalls on the Molo and the gondolas floating on the water. However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture. For the loosely, vigorously painted figures on the Molo, Guardi more likely found an example in the work of the Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco. Furthermore, Guardi's painting is not even half the size of the one by Canaletto.Guardi's small painting and its pendant, a view of the Piazzetta in the direction of San Giorgio Maggiore (also in the Galleria Franchetti, Venice), no longer satisfied the presumably more representative function of Canaletto's painting, but were purchased instead by an individual client who was as interested in the well-known Venetian cityscapes as in Guardi's painterly rendering of them.As with many of Francesco Guardi's paintings, the dating of this work is problematic. It no longer displays the strong stylistic dependence on Canaletto which is characteristic of his earliest cityscapes, nor the brown tonality of his work from the 1760s. The shimmering effects of light and colour, especially in the wall surfaces of the buildings, and the nervous treatment of the sky and the figures on the Molo are characteristic of Guardi's extremely individualistic, transparent style in the last two decades of his career. Therefore, dating this painting to the second half of the 1770s seems plausible	GUARDI, Francesco	View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute	Oil on canvas, 45 x 71 cm	1775-80	landscape	Italian	1751-1800
05178-cornar04.jpg	The frescoes in the Villa Cornaro are Bortolini's first known works. The works on the first floor focus on episodes from the Old Testament, while those on the upper floor are derived from the New Testament. On the first floor, the small rooms to the left of the main hall are dedicated to the narration of the stories of Moses and King Solomon, while those to the right are reserved for episodes relating to Noah, Abraham, and Jacob. The images are extremely simplified in the presentation of the subject matter.The Judgment of Solomon occurs within the royal palace, where only the protagonists in the event are depicted - the king seated on his throne, the two mothers, the executioner who has been called in to cut the contested newborn in half, while the other baby lies abandoned on the ground.

34277-2bathshe.jpg	The composition of this painting is similar to that of another painting of the same subject by Sebastiano Ricci, now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. Both painting follow the scheme used for representing the toilette of Venus. Bathsheba is identified only by the barely visible spying figure in the Budapest painting and by the figure of a maid approaching with a letter from King David.Apparently Ricci liked to use buildings with columns to close up the background, no doubt inspired by Veronese. Slender columns, light, almost floating balconies provide a picturesquely decorative framework for the figures grouped on the stage in front. The whole scene is pervaded by a shimmering silvery light; shadow and dimness have vanished completely; the painter applies light and colour for modelling. The colouring, with its nacreous lustre, is particularly attractive; the hues are delicately shaded, enhancing the interplay of form and content	RICCI, Sebastiano	Bathsheba at her Bath	Oil on canvas, 119 x 199 cm	c. 1724	religious	Italian	1701-1750
41356-02sancta.jpg	The picture shows the upper zone of the east wall. The representation is divided into two fields which is unusual, but it can be explained here by the window located in the centre of the wall. The figures are characterized by rigid contours and modeling of their bodies and attire. Their faces are strongly standardized, following a fixed canon	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Pope Nicholas III Presented to Christ by Sts Peter and Paul (east wall)	Fresco	1278-79	religious	Italian	1251-1300
26621-07_5nw.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper right corner of the Separation of the Earth from the Waters (above the prophet Daniel).The poses of the pairs of ignudi become gradually more dynamic and agitated. The two above the Persian Sibyl (at the left) bend backward in opposite directions, while one of those above the prophet Daniel (at right) bends forward, casting an apprehensive glance at the viewer, and the other raises his arm in a movement reminiscent of Hellenistic sculptures of dancing fauns	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Ignudo	Fresco	1511	religious	Italian	1501-1550
28873-10moriso.jpg	Berthe Morisot's style was principally influenced by Manet then, following his death by Renoir, in particular his paintings of women, as in the present work, in which she depicted a young woman getting dressed in front of a cheval-glass (a long mirror mounted on swivels in a frame)	MORISOT, Berthe	The Cheval-Glass	Oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm	1877-79	genre	French	1851-1900
25047-altar1.jpg	The Master of the Holy Blood was a Bruges follower of Quentin Massys and he takes his name from a triptych in the Holy Blood Museum in Bruges, which formed the nucleus around which his oeuvre has been reconstructed. This triptych in the Groeninge Museum - displayed in the original frame - is one of his best surviving altarpieces.The main scene represents a Rest on the Flight into Egypt in which the seated Virgin with the Child on her lap is accompanied by St Catherine, who as Christ's bride receives the symbolic ring, and St Barbara who holds a peacock's feather in her hand. It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines. There is an echo of Memling in both the general layout as a triptych and the composition of the main scene, which is remotely reminiscent of the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).In the middle ground of the rocky landscape three angels are picking figs (a `poetic' variant of the palm-tree miracle) and on the right walks Joseph, perhaps taking the figs to Mary, who indeed holds a fig in her left hand. The donors on the wings, protected respectively by St Joachim and St Judocus, were identified as Joachim Christiaens, orator of the deanery in Bruges (regularly mentioned between 1535 and 1552) and city councillor (in 1530, 1534, 1536 and 1544), and his second wife Jossine Lamsins. In the background of the three panels small scenes are depicted from the legend of the saints in the foreground. On the left wing at the level of the founder's head is the Preaching of St John the Baptist, a scene connected with the patron saint of the former donor. Above this on the hill is the Annunciation to Joachim, which was added later. Behind St Catherine, on the far left next to the rocks, is her martyrdom with the wheel and the heavenly lightning. Behind St Barbara in front of the rocks is the shepherd with his flock who will betray Barbara's hideaway in the rocks to her father. He is shown talking to Barbara's father, while in the scene above Barbara is being threatened by her father in the cave. The pilgrim begging for alms in the right wing at the back is connected with the story of St Judocus.The exterior features an Annunciation in grisaille on a red marbled background.The triptych, which dates from around 1520-25, is the first work by this anonymous master to be found in which donor figures appear, and since it is clearly of Bruges origin, there can be no more doubt about his being active in Bruges.Joachim Christiaens died in 1552 and Jossine Lamsins in 1557. They were both buried by St Michael's altar on the south side of St Donatian's Cathedral, which was probably also the original destination of the triptych	MASTER of the Holy Blood	Virgin and Child with St Catherine and St Barbara	Oil on oak panel, 87,5 x 66 cm (central panel), 88,5 x 28 cm (each wing)	1520-25	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

08827-death1.jpg	In the second half of the 18th century Cignaroli, a native of Verona, was one of the most important representatives of the academic trend. He was fond of large historical compositions and heroic themes, his chief concern being accurate design and historical authenticity, while, in compliance with the changing taste of art and with the new ideas of classicism, he rejected playfulness, facile lightness and pictorial arbitrariness. His dramatic paintings of sombre tone, to be seen in the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts, are didactic in spirit and meant to illustrate exemplary conduct.The painting is signed with the master's name in Greek characters. Its companion-piece, The Death of Cato, is also in Budapest	CIGNAROLI, Giambettino	The Death of Socrates	Oil on canvas, 202 x 271 cm	1762	historical	Italian	1701-1750
25049-lucretia.jpg	Lucretia, the virtuous wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide, as she could not endure the shame of being raped by Sextus Tarquinius, as Livy related. This deed secured the legendary Roman lady a place in the series  of exemplary females that in European  painting, particularly in court circles, were depicted as examples of virtue.In this painting Lucretia is a genteel Flemish bourgeois lady, who having undone her fashionable gown, grasp the dagger with both hands and stabs herself in the heart. This makes the muddy-green veil on her head start an elegant dance and the wide arms of the gown flutter gently. Lucretia is unaccompanied by any of the protagonists of the story, a characteristic of this painting that corresponds to the trend shared by both the North and the South	MASTER of the Holy Blood	Lucretia	Oil on panel, 65 x 49 cm	c. 1530	historical	Flemish	1501-1550
07263-canal713.jpg	Northumberland House at Charing Cross was the London residence of the Earl of Northumberland, who commissioned Canaletto to paint this picture. The house had recently been inherited and refashioned, and Canaletto concentrated his attention on its elegant and mellow façade. The impressive appearance of the building is enhanced by its towers which are surmounted by gilt weather vanes, and the row of obelisks that support lamps on the pavement before it. The house was eventually demolished in 1873, making way for Northumberland Avenue, and the lion above the doorway was then moved to Syon House in Isleworth, Middlesex, where it can still be seen.Canaletto created far more than just a celebration of a particular building, however; he also provides us with an invaluable record of its surroundings, and a vivid impression of the capital coming to life early in the morning. To the right is the statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur (c. 1595-c. 1650) that now stands at the entrance of Whitehall from Trafalgar Square, and at the left is the entrance to the Strand and the Golden Cross Inn, which has a sign standing in front of it.The painting was much copied and engravings were made after it; as a result of the distribution of these copies, it was to have a significant influence on the work of English artists who depicted urban scenes	CANALETTO	London: Northumberland House	Oil on canvas, 84 x 137 cm	1752	landscape	Italian	1701-1750
35743-wheat_f.jpg	In Ruisdael's paintings of the 1670s, like this one, flat landscape subjects are characteristic, as are the converging lines of earth and sky and the alteration of shadow and sunlight. The tiny figures who populate Ruisdael's canvases - indeed, all human activities - are ultimately dwarfed by the vast canopy of sky and immense, towering clouds. This vision of nature is impressive and powerful yet never loses its wistful, melancholic beauty	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Wheat Fields	Oil on canvas, 100 x 130 cm	1670s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
07717-5altar2.jpg	The panels depicting St John the Baptist, the Crucifixion, St Peter, and St Francis (now in various museums) once belonged to a single altarpiece, which was a polyptych that consisted of ten panels arranged in two registers. The original location of the polyptych is not known, it comes perhaps from Loreto or from its environment.

38229-arachne.jpg	"The mythological story of the contest between the goddess Athena (Minerva to the Romans) and the mortal woman Arachne was perhaps told best by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses (Book VI). According to Ovid, Arachne lived in the country of Lydia (which had a legendary reputation for producing some of the most splendid textiles in the ancient world), where she matured into one of the finest weavers ever known. Arachne was in fact so adept at weaving that she became arrogant, and claimed that her ability rivaled that of the goddess Athena.  A contest was arranged, and having been bested by the mortal Arachne, the infuriated goddess cursed the girl, turning her into a spider in punishment for her effrontery.Strozzi's depiction of Arachne is part of a group of bust length depictions of female allegorical and historical figures and of saints that he began to create early on, perhaps in response to the visit to Genoa of Simon Vouet in 1620-22.  Whatever their inspiration, Strozzi produced these beautiful ""portraits"" throughout his career, adapting his depictions to the theme at hand - refined and ethereal for his saints; sensual and seductive for his profane subjects"	STROZZI, Bernardo	Arachne	Oil on cedar panel, 57 x 45 cm	1628-33	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
38645-officer.jpg	An officer set against a dark undefined background, stands on the left, looking down on a young man opposite him, who is seated with his legs apart at a simple low table writing a letter, and leaning forward in deep concentration. In Dutch seventeenth-century art it was usually the women who were represented in the act of writing letters, associated with love and courtship. Terborch depictions of officers writing or receiving letters is without precedent. Earlier scenes with officers and soldiers were set in guardrooms. Dirck Hals, Jan Miense Molenaer, Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde focused on the disruptive characters of soldiers as they drank, gambled, quarrelled and assaulted civilians	TERBORCH, Gerard	An Officer Writing a Letter	Oil on oak panel, 41 x 28 cm	1657-58	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
42764-4transfi.jpg	Accompanied by Peter, James and John, Jesus had gone to Mount Tabor to pray, where the disciples were witnesses to his transfiguration (St. Matthew 17, 5). Unlike Raphael's Transfiguration, in which the Transfiguration, Resurrection and Ascension are combined in the figure of Christ, Veronese's sticks to the text in emphasizing the mystic moment of transfiguration. Linked in a richly graded scale of colour, Christ, Moses and Elijah greatly resemble the figures in his Coronation of the Virgin (in San Sebastiano) in style. The angels tumbling from the clouds and the eloquent gestures of the prostrate disciples provide the dramatic touches	VERONESE, Paolo	Transfiguration of Christ	Oil on canvas, 555 x 260 cm	1555-56	religious	Italian	1551-1600

21328-nicole.jpg	Leaving his poverty-stricken home at the age of 15, La Tour first entered the workshop of an etcher in Paris, then worked in the studio of the painter Jacques-Jean Spoede. With a letter of recommendation from an English ambassador he went to England where he was much impressed by van Dyck's art of portrayal. On his return to Paris he took up pastel painting, possibly inspired by Rosalba Camera's success in Paris in 1720/21. After some experiments he soon came to excel at pastel portraits, surpassing all his rivals, even Peronneau, and gaining great favour at court. La Tour was most demanding in his art so that the execution of a work was often slow, and it was nine years before he produced a work which would admit him to the Academy. His Portrait of Mme de Pompadour of 1755 (Paris, Louvre) and of the President de Rieux in his Study (Paris, Louvre) represent two of the few full-length pastel portraits in existence. His portraits show a vigourous handling and a perceptive grasp of character	LA TOUR, Maurice Quentin de	Portrait of Nicole Richard as Child	Pastel on greyish paper, 454 x 358 mm	1748-50	portrait	French	1701-1750
28530-2trouvi2.jpg	A famous seaside resort on the Normandy coast, Trouville was one of the most popular holiday destinations for Parisian society at around this time. The elegant building is one of the plush, new holiday hotels on the Normandy coast, an area with which the painter had been familiar since childhood. In this painting, thanks to the rapid, expressive brushwork, the clouds appear foreshortened and the flags are fluttering as if in tatters in the wind. Even the figures, like the man raising his hat on the left, are sketchily captured with just a few brush strokes	MONET, Claude	Hôtel des Roches Noires in Trouville	Oil on canvas, 81 x 59 cm	1870	landscape	French	1851-1900
14908-early10.jpg	From November 1884 to June 1885 Gauguin lived in Copenhagen with his wife and family, and it was there that he painted this self-portrait. His letters to friends in Paris chronicle what was for him a difficult period - he missed the cultural life of Paris, disliked the Danes, his wife's family in particular, and the harsh climate meant that he could do little work in the open air. Increasingly he was forced to work indoors, without a model, and his subject matter betrays these constraints. His work became increasingly premeditated. However, in the execution, particularly in the flickering brushwork, this painting is still close to the work of his Impressionist years.Gauguin's rather romantic characterization of the solitary figure labouring in a garret establishes the tenor of much later self-portraits, in which he depicted himself as artistic martyr, culminating in the series of works of 1889 in which he increasingly identified with Christ	GAUGUIN, Paul	Gauguin at His Easel	Oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm	1885	portrait	French	1851-1900

26023-13john.jpg	The symbolic gesture whereby Jesus places a wedding ring on the finger of St Catherine of Alexandria caused this altarpiece to be identified for many years as the Mystic marriage of St Catherine. Nevertheless, it is clearly dedicated to the Virgin and the two St Johns. Together with the Gdansk Last Judgment and the Lübeck Passion, this is one of the three biggest triptychs that Memling ever painted. The three altarpieces are also distributed evenly throughout his career, and hence serve as crucial milestones in the development of his oeuvre. The St John altarpiece is dated 1479, and is thus located precisely half-way between the Gdansk (1467) and Lübeck (1491) triptychs.The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives.The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned. The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between. The only extant examples are, in fact, the Virgo inter Virgines from the circle of the Master of Flémalle in Washington and a similar composition, this time set in a room, by Rogier van der Weyden, several fragments of which have survive. They are not, however, comparable in formal terms. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new. As is the case with the architecture, Memling appears to have developed here upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele. The Apocalypse is new too. There is no sign of any other representation prior to Memling in which the Book of Revelation is played out before St John's eyes in its entirety in a single, undivided painting. Only in the Beheading of StJohn the Baptist did Memling prefer to paraphrase a Van der Weyden composition (St John altarpiece, Berlin, Staatliche Museen). However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism.In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital. An old inscription on the bottom member of the frame gives the date 1479 and the name of the artist Johannes Memling. With the exception of the Floreins triptych in the same hospital, this is the only work by Memling to be authenticated by an original (in this case subsequently overpainted) inscription. The donors were also identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital. The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady. The two female saints, Catherine and Barbara, were frequently invoked in adversity. Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community	MEMLING, Hans	St John Altarpiece	Oil on oak panel, 173,6 x 173,7 cm (central), 176 x 78,9 cm (each wing)	1474-79	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

11324-512delac.jpg	Géricault had inspired in Delacroix his fascination with horses, the emblematic beasts of Romantic painting. But his love of horses was fully satisfied only in Morocco. Thereafter the Arab horses that he had seen and drawn during his voyage constituted a kind of repertoire. For one of his last paintings, Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable, he drew on a scene that he had witnessed in Tangier, when the horses of Mornay and the English Consul were fighting. No anatomical studies lie behind this painting. Once again, it is the violence of the combat that he portrays; the power and energy of the animals, an effect emphasised by the strong contrasts of light and shade	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable	Oil on canvas, 64,6 x 81 cm	1860	genre	French	1801-1850

40370-2battle.jpg	This is the central panel of the three paintings representing the battle won by Florence against Siena allied with Visconti, the ruling family of Milan. It took place on June 1st 1432 in San Romano, half way between Florence and Pisa. The picture shows the conclusive combat between the captains of the two armies: Niccol&#242; da Tolentino unseating Bernardino della Ciarda.Uccello's obsession with displaying his mastery of perspective (such as the long white and red lances or the exceptional horses that have rolled over on the ground) and the dramatic nature of the clash between the knights combine with his almost magical story telling. This is underpinned by the use of unreal colours and light as if describing some fabulous tale of chivalrous adventure	UCCELLO, Paolo	Bernardino della Ciarda Thrown Off His Horse	Tempera on wood, 182 x 220 cm	1450s	historical	Italian	1401-1450
20127-anaemic.jpg	Van Hoogstraten's most concentrated period of genre painting production occurred only during the last years of his career, around 1670&#151;71. These later pictures exhibit limited subject matter focusing primarily upon domestic themes. Especially fascinating is his Anaemic Lady (and its pendant of Two Women by a Cradle, dated 1670, Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield). In the Anaemic Lady a taciturn physician examines a flask containing the urine of an ailing young woman while another man (her husband?) looks on. This event takes place in a well-appointed house; the recession of space through two rooms in the background allows the viewer to scrutinize some very interesting paintings hanging on the walls and a sliver of a brilliantly illuminated gilt-leather wall-hanging. The inclusion of gilt-leather wall-hangings (an expensive decorative accouterment at this time), costly paintings, and sumptuous fabrics enhances the aura of opulence exuded by the painting	HOOGSTRATEN, Samuel van	The Anaemic Lady	Oil on canvas, 70 x 55 cm	1660s	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
11211-1890s_06.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	Nude Stepping into a Bathtub	Pastel, 29 x 25 cm	1895-1900	genre	French	1851-1900

10233-1venus06.jpg	The provenance of this picture is unknown. It is one of a series of paintings in various sizes, representing Venus or a female nude, turned out in quantities by Cranach and his studio; these were popular among the clientele of humanists for whom he worked. However, this conception of Venus belongs to a German tradition which derives its inspiration from Gothic art. The juvenile air, the slender forms, the tiny breasts an narrow hips, the rounded forehead, all go to make up the physical characteristics of the women (including the Virgins) represented in German art since the fourteenth century. This is quite unlike the conception of Dürer's Eve (1504), which was based on an objective and scientific study of the proportions of the human body. The strange pirouetting movements of the legs, crossed over one another, occurs frequently in the engravings of Master E.S. As indicated in the romances and the books of sermons, a swaying walk was one of the ways of expressing worldly elegance for women of this Gothic world from the fourteenth century; but here this Gothic mannerism meets and contributes to another kind - the 'Mannerism' of art history. Mannerist painters and sculptors, whether Italian, German, or French, all admired what Italian aestheticians called 'la linea serpentina', which seemed to them the most beautiful of all forms.The Venus is clad only in a provocatively transparent veil; in some paintings this is a subsequent addition, but here it is original. The better to set off the ivory whiteness of her body, Cranach has shown it silhouetted against a sombre background of foliage. The landscape conveys in a few strokes an intense impression of the Germanic conception of nature.

39709-1ferra1.jpg	"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.The first painting in this series is The Worship of Venus, whose subject is Love as the source of fertility and regeneration in nature. Titian's composition is based on a description by the late antique writer Philostratus, in his 'Imagines', of a painting of cupids gathering apples in the presence of Venus amid a tree-girt landscape. By basing himself on Philostratus, Titian was in effect recreating a lost masterpiece of antiquity. This would have flattered the patron, who could thus compare himself to Alexander the Great, the patron of Apelles, the most celebrated painter of the ancient world"	TIZIANO Vecellio	The Worship of Venus	Oil on canvas, 172 x 175 cm	1516-18	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

In the centre Christ hangs on the cross, on either side angels carrying basins receive the blood pouring from the wounds. In the foreground the swooning Virgin is supported by Mary Magdalene, and three other holy women, while St John the Evangelist stands grieving nearby. In the compartments on the left are at the top St John the Baptist and below, St Paul. On the right, St James the Greater and St Bartholomew.

40245-0view.jpg	"The Salone dei Mesi (Room of Months) in the Palazzo Schifanoia, one of the masterpieces of Italian palace architecture, was decorated with a series of allegorical frescoes symbolizing the months. The length of the room  is 24 m, the width 11 m and the height 7,5 m. The frescoes are attributed to Cosmè Tura, Francesco del Cossa, Baldassare d'Este and Ercole de' Roberti.On the southern wall January and February, on the eastern wall March, April and May, on the north wall June, July, August and September, on the west wall October, November and December were represented. Due to negligence it was in a very bad state already in the 18th century. Today there remained only fragments of the frescoes on the southern and western walls, while those on the eastern wall and most on the northern are in relatively good condition. This means that the visitor can view the surviving allegories of seven months (March, April, May, June July, August and September). In all allegories the episodes are arranged in a three-tiered, frieze-like manner; in the upper sphere, the sphere of mythology, each month and its planet are paralleled by their ancient divinity in a triumphal procession. The middle layer shows the signs of the zodiac, while below are rendered the courtly events appropriate to the particular time of year.This view of the Salone dei Mesi in the Palazzo Schifanoia shows, from the left to the right, frescoes of the months of September, August, July, June, May, April, and May, respectively. The decoration was commissioned by Borso d'Este. The name Borso gave to this pleasure palace means ""away with boredom."	TURA, Cosm?

35614-16landsc.jpg	Rubens painted this picture at the end of his life when he was living in his country residence at Het Steen. The contrast between the two halves of the composition, a sunlit prosperity on the left and a gloomy wood on the right, suggest an analogy with the Last Judgment, the rainbow representing the Arc of the Covenant.The late landscapes by Rubens, such as this work, with their atmospheric appearance, often in subdued golden light of an early summer evening, make an elegiac impression.

He sojourned in Pont-Aven, and then, on his many travels, painted landscapes, mainly featuring rivers and the coast.

The overall setting, in which a military commander and his entourage are depicted in the right foreground, with a mass of soldiers arranged in a circular arc attacking a fortified building in the left background, appears to have been a popular compositional formula for the artist. The battle represented here is not yet identified. Perhaps the scene represents the fall of Jerusalem to the Roman general Popeye (in late autumn 63 BC).

16713-lange1ve.jpg	Girodet was Jacques-Louis David's favourite pupil. The sense of the mysterious and poetic that he shows in many of his works is what many call the Romantic spirit, although it was already latent in Neoclassicism. Girodet sensed the coming direction in an early stage, although he had been trained to be a Neoclassicist by David.Girodet depicted the actress Mademoiselle Lange as Venus, standing on her couch, her face turned from the viewer. In the mirror that Cupid is holding up to her, the painter, who delighted in hidden references, has shown only one ear. When the actress expressed her annoyance at the painting, Girodet painted her again, this time in mythological form, Mademoiselle Lange as Dana&#235;.The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction.

42298-0802vela.jpg	"""Las Meninas"" is a Portuguese word used to name the Maids of Honour of the Royal children in the 17th century.Las Meninas or The Royal Family is one of the great problem pictures in the history of art. An almost infinite number of interpretations have now been proposed for the scene it shows. At first sight, however, Las Meninas seems to present no problems at all, and indeed appears perfectly straightforward in its sober geometry and good-humoured clarity.It is set in a room in the Alcázar, equipped by Velázquez as a studio, and shows the heiress to the throne, the Infanta Margarita, with her court. Palomino names all those present. The queen's maid of honour, Dona Maria Agustina Sarmiento, one of the meninas, is kneeling at the Infanta's feet, handing her a jug of water. The other maid of honour, Dona Isabel de Velasco stands behind the princess, and beside her we see the grotesquely misshapen female dwarf Mari-Bárbola and the male dwarf Nicolasico Pertusato; the latter, as Palomino points out, is placing his foot on the mastiff lying in front of the group to demonstrate the lethargic animal's good temper. Further back, almost swallowed up in the shadows, are a man described only as guardadamas - a guard or escort to the ladies - and the lady in waiting Do&#241;a Marcela de Ulloa.Velázquez is standing with brush and palette in front of a tall canvas; we can see only the back of it. There are some large pictures hanging on the back wall of the room. Two of them were painted by Velázquez's son-in-law, Mazo, from models by Rubens, and show scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of them another version of the punishment of Arachne. The princess's parents, the king and queen, appear in a dark frame below these pictures, probably the glass of a mirror. To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.There are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Velázquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?It was long thought that Velázquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.A different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place? Despite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth. For it was on the princess that the dynastic hopes of the Spanish Habsburgs rested after the death of Prince Baltasar Carlos"	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Las Meninas or The Family of Philip IV	Oil on canvas, 318 x 276 cm	1656-57	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

40306-109turnf.jpg	Burning of Parliament is the popular name for the fire which destroyed the Palace of Westminster, the home of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on 16 October 1834. The blaze, which started from overheated chimney flues, spread rapidly throughout the medieval complex and developed into the biggest conflagration to occur in London since the Great Fire of 1666, attracting massive crowds. The fire lasted for many hours and gutted most of the Palace. Westminster Hall and a few other parts of the old Houses of Parliament survived the blaze and were incorporated into the New Palace of Westminster, which was built in the Gothic style over the following decades	TURNER, Joseph Mallord William	The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, October 16, 1834	Oil on canvas, 92 x 123 cm	1834-35	historical	English	1801-1850

09781-bentivo.jpg	This signed work is one of most well-known of Lorenzo Costa's artistic production. In the portrait of Bentivoglio there is obviously a sound knowledge of Antonello  Messina's style, but what really dominates is the solidity and sculptural relief of the form, which Costa draws from Venetian painting. This is visible in the sturdy build of the whole figure, the imposing neck, and the well-placed head. Costa, who moved to Bologna from his native Ferrara in 1482, was one of the most interesting and modern exponents of Northern painting in this period	COSTA, Lorenzo the Elder	Portrait of Giovanni II Bentivoglio	Tempera on wood, 55 x 49 cm	c. 1492	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

18242-0603grec.jpg	After a short period of study in Greece, El Greco, one of the most renowned figure in Spanish art, went to Venice in the middle of the sixteenth century, where he worked in Titian's workshop, and where he became familiar with the art of Paolo Veronese, Jacopo Bassano and Tintoretto, as well as works by representatives of the North Italian Mannerist school. Later, in Rome, he was strongly influenced by the work of Michelangelo. By the time he had settled in Toledo around 1576, his art was fully developed. Like most of the painters coming from Italy, he was anxious to enter the service of King Philip II, but the Greek painter's immediacy of passion, ecstatic style, disturbing colours and visionary conceptions did not please the king's academic Italian taste. He was, however, appreciated by the religious orders and the aristocratic patrons of Toledo.The penitent Magdalen must have been painted at the beginning of his years in Toledo because the strong influence of paintings on the same theme by Titian can be observed. The ideal of beauty is still Titian's half-figure pictures of women, but the inner tension of the whole composition and the relation between man and nature already indicate the beginning of Mannerism. The arrangement of the fingers of the right hand is a characteristic feature of El Greco's painting. It is assumed by some critics that the sitter of the painting was Jerónima de las Cuevas, the mistress of the artist	GRECO, El	Mary Magdalen in Penitence	Oil on canvas, 157 x 121 cm	1576-78	religious	Spanish	1551-1600
10952-trompes.jpg	The Baptism of Christ forms the central section of a triptych commissioned by the treasurer of the city of Bruges, Jean Trompes. The wings show the donor's family and patron saints on the inside, and the Virgin and Child and the donor's first wife with St Elizabeth on the outside.Nowhere does the artist demonstrate more clearly both his talents and his limitations. The present scene contains virtually no action. The kneeling figures of John the Baptist and the angel dressed in a sumptuous cope reveal a mutual correspondence in their approximate symmetry and subtly differentiated positions. The panel's central axis is strongly emphasized by the figure of Christ, the dove of the Holy Ghost and the apparition of God the Father.In David's paintings the landscape forming the background to religious scenes takes on the motionless and precious look of something whose serenity opposes it to the tragedy of what is happening in the picture. One has only to look at the forest in the background of the Baptism of Christ, with its huge ivy-covered trunks, the strong rhythm of its escarpments and its foliage standing out against the blue of the distance. The still life of flowers in the foreground is characterized by a dazzling wealth of minute detail.This altarpiece was at one time considered one of the best works of Memling. The study of its wing panels was rightly recommended to landscape painters as the work of a marvellous painter of foliage	DAVID, Gerard	Triptych of Jean Des Trompes (central)	Oil on wood, 127,9 x 96,6 cm	1505	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

(Matthew 1:15-16)At the top of the entrance wall of the chapel, to the right of the viewer, next to the Eleazar-Matthan lunette, there is the one concluding the genealogical sequence of the ancestors of Christ in the Gospel of St Matthew.Sullen and perplexed, wrapped in a huge yellow ochre cloak and seemingly withdrawn, the old man - generally believed to be Jacob - dominates the family group on the left due to his expressive power and the quality of the colour. Similarly, on the right, the female figure, usually thought to be Mary, is more prominent than the other members of the Holy Family and the child holding a mirror. Behind Mary in the shadow, Joseph holds the Christ child, who stretches out an arm toward the round mirror held out at the height of his face by a naked female child, possibly an allegory of the Church.The compositional schemes of the two neighbouring lunettes correspond: in both there is a female figure in the foreground seen in full, or half, profile and facing the outer wall of the chapel, and a male figure, on the internal side, with his torso seen frontally."

03271-trustgod.jpg	Bartolini would often attempt symbolic religious themes. The most notable of these is Trust in God, which the artist intended as a personification of faith. The nudity of the adolescent figure was meant to represent the human soul placing its trust in the Lord, but much of the sculpture's appeal doubtless stems from its undertone of eroticism.The statue was commissioned from Bartolini by Rosa Trivulzio Poldi Pezzoli.

15570-3annunci.jpg	At the height of the Presentation of the Virgin and the Marriage of Mary - above the corner of the chapel and connecting with the rear wall next to the Gothic window - there is the narrow fresco the Annunciation.Again Ghirlandaio has moved the scene of this biblical event to Tuscany and his own era. He was able to find the traditional Renaissance form of a painted window with a view of a landscape in many Florentine palaces. They can still be seen today in Florence, examples being the palaces of the Medici, Ruccelai and Strozzi families. The angel is derived from the Annunciation painted by the young Leonardo da Vinci between 1472 and 1475, now on view in the Galleria degli Uffizi.In contrast to Leonardo's horizontal format, in Ghirlandaio's fresco in the predetermined vertical format his Virgin may be depicted facing the observer in an equally frontal view, but she is standing upright. She is therefore reminiscent of the beautiful picture on the same theme by Lorenzo di Credi, an artist who was also taught by Verrocchio together with Leonardo and Ghirlandaio	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Annunciation	Fresco	1486-90	religious	Italian	1451-1500
31303-triumph.jpg	In Naples, a great part of the finest sculpture of the Quattrocento is Florentine export works by Donatello, Michelozzo, Antonio Rossellino and Benedetto da Maiano. The principal local sculptor is Francesco Laurana. His relief (shown on the picture) on the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso I, reveals him as charming, competent, and to a considerable extent heir to the tradition of Late Gothic realism.In 1453 a triumphal arch built as the entrance to the Castel Nuovo in Naples. This was intended to commemorate the temporary arch that had been erected in front of the cathedral when King Alfonso entered the city in triumph in 1443. Typifying Alfonso's dependence on Spanish staff, the Catalan master Pere Joan (active 1400-58) oversaw the project. Under his direction Pietro da Milano, a Lombard sculptor who had spent his early years working in Ragusa in Dalmatia, supervised the work of at least five master sculptors (including Francesco Laurana) and thirty-three assistants. Sculptural work was allocated to different workers, ensuring a speedy completion of the project.The attic story of this arch is decorated by a relief of The Triumphal Entry of Alfonso into Naples. In this relief, groups of figures, all carefully coordinated in size and scale, even though carved by different hands, enact an idealized and simplified version of Alfonso's triumphal entry into Naples a decade earlier. The sculptors evoke the character and decorum of early Roman imperial reliefs in the proud, calm bearing of nobles who process behind Alfonso, enthroned and elevated on a canopied processional cart, and in the more active figures of the musicians and horsemen who lead the way	PIETRO DA MILANO	Alfonso of Aragon in Triumph with his Court	Marble, half life-size	1452-58	historical	Italian	1451-1500

19658-campovac.jpg	The present painting is one of a handful of cityscapes Jacob de Heusch painted, much influenced by his fellow countryman, the vedutiste Caspar van Wittel. This impressive view of the Roman Forum is a rare topographical representation of the city by the artist. The painter's lively combination of contemporary figures in a topographically accurate setting was typical of the type of views of the city eagerly sought by both Italian collectors and visiting Grand Tourists.Here de Heusch depicts the busy daily life of the Roman Forum, known as the 'Campo Vaccino' since the end of the sixteenth century due to the herds of cows that grazed there.

35015-pieta.jpg	It is already clear in this, his first definitely dated work, that Girolamo Romanino, like Lotto and Savoldo, was reluctant to enter fully into the tradition of Venetian figurative art. The panel was painted for the Chapel of the Holy Passion in the old church of San Lorenzo in Brescia and in it we can see Romanino's predilection for Titian's sonorously rich colour transposed onto a plane of popular narrative strengthened by a romantic, imaginative pathos. Against the background of a landscape which itself seems constricted in its atmosphere of profound anguish, the figures of the foreground seem to float to the surface in sharply cadenced groupings painted in timbres of a blazing quality. The influence of Lombard style which can be noted in the roundish faces painted after the fashion of Bramante, are accompanied by the influence of Northern European painting which can be seen in the view of the town glimpsed through the steamy, stormy atmosphere, in the objective quality of the portrait of the man, in the expressionistic deformation of the little human figures moving around the crosses at Golgotha.In this earliest attributable work by Romanino, the characteristic quality of the artist's style is already evident: an expressionistic realism which seems to offer an extremely personalized reflection of the political, social and religious crises that shook the Western world in the first half of the sixteenth century	ROMANINO, Girolamo	Piet?

09907-courb411.jpg	Courbet's marine scenes were often painted at Étretat, a Norman fishing village popular among artists of his generation and, later, the Impressionists. Its great cliffs, rising so precipitously from the beach and from the waters provided a striking contrast to sand-bound or storm-tossed boats below, and with the ever-changing sea and sky. Courbet painted many views of this site in the late 1860s and early 1870s. This painting stress a rock formation known as Aval or Aiouille, where a natural flying buttress appears to support an equally natural, crenellated tower. This sense of implicit architecture suggests a great city lost in primeval times	COURBET, Gustave	Cliffs at Étretat	Oil on canvas, 66 x 82 cm	1870	landscape	French	1851-1900
12322-8windsor.jpg	The painting is a portable triptych of a type that was fairly widely produced in Italy during the early fourteenth century, essentially for private worship. For the purposes of travel the wings would have closed inwards covering the centre panels and lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding. The backs of the wings were most probably painted with imitation marble or porphyry, perhaps with decorative motifs, as opposed to narrative scenes. The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills. Some of the finest surviving examples are Florentine or Sienese in origin. The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings. The centre panel in particular is of a quality worthy of Duccio himself. The same might almost be said of the lower scenes in each of the wings, certainly in their design even if the actual execution reveals evidence of assistants (for example, the gold decoration on the cloth of honour behind Christ and the Virgin Enthroned, lower right). The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.The iconography of the panels is also significant. Paradoxically, the inner religious consistency is derived from the unusual combination of scenes, especially the pairing of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings. The enthronement of the Virgin twice (lower left and lower right), for instance, suggests a temporal sequence before and after Christ's death as represented in the centre. The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept). These connotations and the treatment of the crucifixion in a devotional, as opposed to a narrative sense, imply a Franciscan origin for this triptych. The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930. After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame. This, too, was considered to be inappropriate and the present reconstruction of the triptych was devised in 1988, although further thought has since been given to the angle at which the two wings should be positioned in order to make proper visual sense of the architecture.

23175-13monaco.jpg	This panel formed part of a predella, which included a Visitation (Courtauld Galleries, London), a Nativity (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an Adoration of the Magi (Courtauld Galleries, London), and a Flight into Egypt (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg).The oblong frame, with a semicircle on every corner and angular projections between them, divides the picture into three parts and Lorenzo Monaco made good use of the possibilities offered by the unusual shape of the frame. He placed the Virgin and her Child-isolated from the other figures-into the central, widest part. The Virgin is riding the ass side-saddle, as though she were sitting on a throne, and she is turned towards us. To indicate the direction of her course, her body is a little bent backwards. The oblique line of her body suggests a straight line between the upper point of the frame and the bottom inward angle on the right, and this diagonal axis is further stressed by the ass's foreleg, stepping forwards, which, continuing the same line, eventually ends in the semicircle. A similar connection between the composition and the frame can be observed in the hindmost leg of the ass and the bottom left semicircle. The oblique line of the leg is a reflected image of the axis which was mentioned previously. The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them. The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame. (According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.) The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back. By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical. This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style. Counterparts of the two women, with the long, even and soft folds of their draperies, or of the Virgin's graceful, aristocratic figure, could be found anywhere in the art of the period. On the other hand, the vigorous and definite personality of Joseph can be imagined only in Florentine art, which had old, democratic traditions. In vain would we try to find this image in the representations of Joseph as the humble old man in Northern art	LORENZO Monaco	The Flight into Egypt	Tempera on poplar, 24 x 39 cm (with frame)	1405-10	religious	Italian	1401-1450
15209-david.jpg	Orazio Gentileschi's brooding image of David contemplating the head of Goliath reflects a new type of meditative image introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Caravaggio. Traditionally David was shown either as an uncompromised biblical hero slaying Goliath or as a triumphant youth displaying the giant's decapitated head. In Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath (Galleria Borghese, Rome), which was likely to have been sent from Naples around 1609 as a gift for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the adolescent hero gazes tenderly at his victim's head, creating a strong, almost erotic, bond. Orazio's David does not interact with Goliath's head, rather he stands beside it lost in a moment of deep introspection, evoking a pensive atmosphere similar to the mood generated in Caravaggio's St John the Baptist. Like the St John, David's body is pushed towards the picture plane and set off against a background of dense, dark foliage. This verdant background is strikingly different from the one in Orazio's small copper version (Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin), in which David is framed by a rocky cliff. The difference has led some critics to suggest that Agostino Tassi was responsible for the landscape in the Spada picture, but there is no conclusive proof to substantiate this.Unlike the Berlin copper, where David is seen full-length, in the Spada version his body is cropped just below the knee and Goliath's head is turned upwards towards the viewer. It has been suggested that the Spada canvas was cut down at the bottom. However, technical evidence shows that instead it was extended on all four sides. Thus the picture would have focused more directly on the contemplative and melancholic David and the head of Goliath would have appeared to rest on the edge of the frame. A copy of the Berlin composition (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) was paired with a version of Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes , but there is no evidence to indicate that two pictures of such contrasting moods were originally conceived as pendants.

17983-07scene.jpg	"The Preaching to the Birds and Blessing Montefalco took place in Umbria. The precise topographical description of the places is noticeable. In the middle distance a view of the Umbrian town of Bevagna can be seen, near to which the preaching to the birds is supposed to have taken place. The mighty Monte Subasio, with a little church half way up, and a view of the town of Assisi, form the background. In the background on the left, at the foot of the table mountain, lies Assisi with the fortress and magnificent monastery church of San Francesco that was not built until after St Francis' death. The topography of the cities is also in accordance with reality: Assisi lies to the north west of Montefalco.The preaching Francis is pointing upwards to indicate that he is speaking about God. The 13 different kinds of birds, including a hoopoe, a swan, a thrush, a magpie, a pheasant and a dove, underline by their exceptional, unnatural gathering the godliness of the conversation.Almost in the centre of the picture, the saint and his companion appear simultaneously a second time. The two scenes are compositionally separated by the two figures which are seen standing in profile. Not until they reach the background do the two landscapes meet. Various chronological levels become evident in the conscious division of the pictorial space. On the wall the city coat of arms of Montefalco appears.Before St Francis, four men are reverently kneeling. The one in the front is wearing a Franciscan habit and a cap bearing the inscription M. MARCUS. He is holding a bishop's miter in his hands. This might be the ""Master Marcus"" who towards the end of the 14th century was the bishop of Sarsina and later of Marsico Nuovo. Fra Jacopo, who commissioned the work, is the second kneeling Franciscan. The other people are presumably members of the Calvi family, which in the 15th century acted on several occasions as donors for the church of San Francesco in Montefalco.The inscription beneath the picture describes what is taking place: QUANDO B.

These works show the distinctive personality of this artist in the genre. Their low viewpoint endows the flower pieces with a degree of monumentality and reflects the fact that they were conceived for display over windows or doors, or another such high point on a wall.

The scene depicts a nurse who is evidently preparing a meal for an invalid. While the delicacy of the treatment is typical of eighteenth century, the choice of a genre subject shows the influence of seventeenth century Dutch domestic scenes, which Chardin studied in his youth.At the Salon of 1747 it was exhibited together with a companion piece. It is debated whether the other painting was the Kitchen Maid or the Servant Returning from the Market	CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon	The Attentive Nurse	Oil on canvas, 46 x 37 cm	1747	genre	French	1701-1750
31065-2august2.jpg	In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St Michael was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).Archangel Michael is portrayed as an ancient warrior, his athletic limbs made more elegant by his precious armour, by the graceful tunic and by his beautiful boots decorated by with tiny pearls.

41375-06madonn.jpg	This panel, originally attributed to Simone Martini, was discovered in Naples in 1904. As early as 1906 this attribution was already contested and the painting was reassigned to a variety of different painters in the circle of Martini; among them Naddo Ceccarelli, Lippo Memmi, and Donato Martini. At the same time, a number of art historians supported the attribution of the work to Simone Martini.More recently, scholars have agreed in assigning it to a close collaborator of Martini, an anonymous master who takes his eponym from this painting , which was formerly kept in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome (The Master of Palazzo Venezia). This panel was once the central element of a polyptych, to which a St Peter and Mary Magdalene at the National Gallery in London are also considered to have belonged. The reconstruction of the career and artistic personality of this painter has shed light on the artist's exquisite transposition of Simone Martini's formal vocabulary. The dating of the piece has been assigned to some time after the anonymous master's 1333 Annunciation (Uffizi Gallery, Florence), perhaps when Simone had already left for Avignon	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Madonna and Child	Tempera on panel, 73 x 41,5 cm	1330s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08992-07italia.jpg	The painting is signed and dated: Claude in. f.  Romae 1642. The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 64).A shepherd-couple are placed in the foreground of this southern landscape. The woman is seated on a rock and is listening to the shepherd playing the shawm. To the right of the picture is a tent supported by a tree, and on the left a stone bridge leads to a ruined Roman temple. In the background the open sea is half-obscured by the mist of a warm summer's day.The painter, whose real name was Claude Gellée, was a native of Lorraine. When he first arrived in Rome, he worked as a pastrycook, then as assistant to the landscape painter Agostino Tassi, whom he helped with decorative work. Not much is known about his early career. It was only in his thirties that he began to acquire stature and reputation as an artist in his own right. The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons. People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself. In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations. The book is preserved today in the British Museum under the title Liber Veritatis; in it the Berlin landscape features on p. 64, and according to a note written on the verso, the work was commissioned by a patron in Paris.This picture is recorded as having been in English private ownership in the early eighteenth century: until 1722 it was in the possession of the Duke of Portland, who sold it to the Earl of Scarbrough. About 1818 it passed into the possession of Count Pourtalès and from him, in 1865, into the collection of the Marquis de la Ganay, from whom Bode bought it in 1881 for the Berlin Gallery	CLAUDE LORRAIN	Italian Coastal Landscape	Oil on canvas, 97 x 131 cm	1642	landscape	French	1651-1700

09602-day.jpg	The painting was probably cut down slightly on the sides and top, painted originally for a local church at the same time that he was working on the frescoes in the Cathedral. It can be considered as the companion of the Nativity (The Night) in Dresden.Considered his masterpiece among the altarpieces, the composition is built up as a remote variation of the pyramidal arrangements favoured by Leonardo, broken by the dominating verticality of St Jerome on the left. The sacra conversazione is transformed into an informal and incidental narrative that takes place in a landscape. A makeshift red canopy has been constructed in the foreground, where his figures are massed on a compact, constricted plane. Their poses are particularly hard to reconstruct because they are either figures covered by draperies that effectively hide their structure, or are in intricate unnatural positions. As Correggio grew older, he began to take liberties with the conventions regarding the proportion of figures. Saint Jerome on the left, accompanied by his identifying lion, occupies almost the entire height of the painting, assuming a dominant role even in relation to the Madonna and Child. His thick, muscular right leg is strikingly long in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head.The pictorial effects derive from a masterly application of the oil paint, confident and elegant colour, and idealized, refined faces	CORREGGIO	Madonna and Child with Sts Jerome and Mary Magdalen (The Day)	Oil on panel, 235 x 141 cm	1525-28	religious	Italian	1501-1550

26005-02last4.jpg	The closed altarpiece shows the donor and his wife kneeling in prayer, each before a niche containing respectively a statue of the Virgin and Child and St Michael battling with demons. Their escutcheons are mounted on the polygonal base of the niches. These were identified as belonging to the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani (1415-1492) and Caterina di Francesco Tanagli (1446-1492). Tani was an agent of the Medici bank in Bruges in 1450, before becoming its manager in 1455. He was ousted by Tommaso Portinari in 1465. Tani married in Florence in 1466, and his wife bore a daughter (one of several) on 8 June 1471. He drew up his will on 12 December 1467, the same month as he was sent back north to save the London branch from bankruptcy. The holy figures represented here evidently relate first and foremost to the devotion of the donors. The coats-of-arms were originally reversed - in other words, the man's arms appeared in the woman's panel, and vice versa.Before departing for London in December 1467, Tani founded a chapel dedicated to St Michael at his employer's church in Fiesole and drew up his will. He probably also made funeral arrangements in the customary manner. He will then have required an altarpiece, which he ordered from Memling some time after the end of 1467 during his stay in the north. The painting was, therefore, largely executed during his stay in London between 1467 and 1469, from where he could monitor its progress. The iconography of the altarpiece is clarified by its destination. St Michael has been selected here first and foremost as the saint to whom the chapel was dedicated, and only in the second place as Tani's patron. This also explains the absence of the woman's patron.

09263-virgin_c.jpg	This panel, showing the influence of the Sienese school, depicts the Virgin and Child enthroned, flanked by St Catherine of Alexandria, St Veronica, St Mustiola and St Lucy. The little-known St Mustiola was the patron saint of Chiusi, an Umbrian town only fifty kilometres from Orvieto and Perugia. Her inclusion in the present work perhaps indicates that the panel was commissioned by a patron from Chiusi.The present work is a rare signed example by Cola.

10756-apocalyp.jpg	After attending the drawing school of the Royal Dublin Society and spending a brief period in London, Danby settled around 1813 for two decades in Bristol, in whose environs he painted the small, exquisite landscapes on which his fame today largely rests. Forced to leave England in 1829 due to financial problems and a marital scandal, Danby established himself in Paris and Geneva, where he remained until 1840. His oils, ink drawings, and watercolours, focussing on lyrically romantic landscapes, represents one of the most significant contributions made by any artist to nineteenth-century British landscape painting. He also concerned himself with religious themes, treated in a visionary manner.The present painting is presumably one of four depicting scenes from the Apocalypse. In a Romantic nocturnal landscape evoking the infinity of the cosmos appears a vision of the giant angel described in Chapter 10 of the Apocalypse, descending in a cloud from heaven with a rainbow over his head and legs like columns of fire. The natural scene in which the visionary apparition is set evinces a coloration and sophisticated painterly handling that explain Danby's rank as one of the finest British landscapists of the nineteenth century	DANBY, Francis	Scene from the Apocalypse	Oil on canvas, 61 x 77 cm	c. 1829	mythological	Irish	1801-1850
32435-antioch.jpg	This early painting by Preti is notable for its rare literary subject and clear stylistic allusion to Paolo Veronese. The subject of this picture is taken from Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata (1580). The heroine Erminia inscribed his lover Tancred's name on every tree and branch. The choice of subject matter was doubtless inspired by Pietro da Cortona and Nicolas Poussin, both of whom had painted stories from Tasso in Venetian influenced styles	PRETI, Mattia	Erminia, Princess of Antioch	Oil on canvas, 98 x 73 cm	c. 1640	mythological	Italian	1651-1700

31000-ecstasy.jpg	This is among Piazzetta's finest paintings and is also a masterpiece of eighteenth-century sacred art. The altarpiece (which was originally in the church of S. Maria d'Aracoeli in Vicenza) is composed along three parallel diagonals that cut across the composition from left to right. The most important section is in the centre where Piazzetta contrasts the luminous and robust figure of the wonderful angel with the lifeless, dark, and heavy figure of the fainting saint. The descriptive detail (such as the scruffy wooden structure or the figure of Brother Leo with his back to us) accentuate the feeling of isolation and intense mysticism.

17191-cypres02.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 613, JH 1746.This painting was executed in June 1889 after the beginning of his voluntary confinement at the asylum of Saint Paul in Saint-Rémy. The loaded brushstrokes and the swirling, undulating forms are typical of the artist's late work.Living in the asylum in Saint-Rémy, van Gogh repeatedly turned his attention to the no-man's-land between the wide world out there and his own confined world. When he looked across the low wall that enclosed the asylum, he found a whole world of subjects awaiting him. There was a range of hills, the Alpilles, with countless olive trees at their feet and an occasional solitary cypress crowning them to counteract the gentle ups and downs of the hills with a bold vertical.The immense cypresses in this painting are seen so close that the top of one is cropped by the upper edge of the picture.

14397-st_bruno.jpg	St Bruno was canonised in 1623, and so appeared frequently at that time in paintings from throughout southern Europe.Le Puy is the capital of the Haute Loire, part of a large upland area, the Massif central, in the southern central region of France. The large number of Romanesque churches in and around the town bear testimony to the fact that it flourished in the Middle ages. It was never an area noted for painting activity, and the return of Guy François from Rome to his native region was therefore to be of great significance in local terms, much more so than similar events in other centres where there was more than one painter active. Guy François was to work in isolation for more than thirty years, gradually diluting his art as memories of what he had learned in Rome faded. The pictures that he painted in France nearly all remain in and around Le Puy.It is only in recent years that the Italian period of Guy François has been reconstructed and his Italian pictures disentangled from the work of Carlo Saraceni. Saraceni, a difficult artist to define, was essentially eclectic, with an unusual skill in brushwork almost akin to that of a northerner. He assimilated many influences, ranging from Caravaggio to the German ERlsheimer.The picture by François that most shows the influence of Saraceni is the Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth, now in the Musée de l'Ain at Bourg-en-Bresse. Like much of François's work, it was intended as a large altarpiece. His altarpieces that survived in the Le Puy area, in the churches for which they were painted, are often surrounded by a provincial version of a sculptured and stuccoed framework in the Italian Baroque style. Although commonplace in Italy, such pictures in situ are rare in France; most seventeenth century altarpieces by the major painters are now in museums. The Holy Family altarpiece has the simplified forms sometimes found in works by Saraceni and also the strong lighting suitable for a prominent position in a church, where the picture would normally be seen from a distance.The strength of some of Guy François' compositions has led some authorities to suggest that he was influenced by Nicolas Tournier, but the most likely explanations for their superficial similarity are that both artists brought back from Italy similar Caravaggesque influences, and that both of them were forced to rely on what they had experienced and learned without renewed contact with their sources. Both painter had a predilection for monumental scale, although François never achieved Tournier's dramatic intensity. Instead he provided, in an area isolated from all artistic contact, a whole group of soundly painted and striking altarpieces	FRANÇOIS, Guy	Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth	Oil on canvas, 210 x 153 cm	-	religious	French	1601-1650
22761-ecstasy.jpg	In his second Epistle to the Corinthians, St Paul describes the revelations that were made to him. Liss portrays one of the apostle's visions, `how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter'. Above the seated apostle, who is surrounded by books, an angel draws aside a curtain; terrified, Paul shrinks back from the expanse of heaven revealed to him. Angels playing musical instruments gambol in the clouds, and in the distance the Trinity appears. The colours range from the deep violet of Paul's cloak through the green of the curtain to the most delicate yellow, blue and pink of the clouds. This painting with its extraordinary wealth of brilliant colour is one of the artist's finest works and seems to anticipate the Venetian painting of the eighteenth century.With the exception of Adam Elsheimer, Johann Liss was the most outstanding German painter of the seventeenth century. He was born in Schleswig-Holstein c. 1597, spent several years studying in the Netherlands, where he came into contact with the Haarlem painters, principally Goltzius and Buytewech, and with the Flemish followers of Caravaggio in Antwerp (Janssens, Jordaens). Liss then made his way to Italy via Paris. To begin with, he worked in Rome, where he was a member of the Netherlandish artists' colony, and exactly when he settled in Venice is not known. Until his early death, supposedly a victim of the plague which broke out in 1629, he continued to work in Venice and it was in these last years that he produced his best-known works, among them The Ecstasy of St Paul. Together with Domenico Feti, Liss played an important part in reviving the use of rich colours, a Venetian tradition which had ended with Tintoretto.In the seventeenth century this painting was in the famous collection of the Amsterdam merchant Gerrit Reynst (died 1658), which consisted mainly of works by Venetian masters and included a companion-piece, The Vision of St Peter, which was subsequently lost. Both pictures were engraved by Jeremias Falck and attributed to Johann Liss, but it seems certain that the St Peter picture was not the work of Liss but of Domenico Feti, who was a close friend of the German painter. It may be that after Feti's death (1623), his patron decided to commission Johann Liss to paint the companion-picture to the St Peter. The Ecstasy of St Paul came up for sale in Amsterdam in 1722 with the Van de Amory Collection and found its way through a Florentine art-dealer into the Berlin collection of A. von Frey, from which it passed in 1919 to the Picture Gallery	LISS, Johann	The Ecstasy of St Paul	Oil on canvas, 80 x 58 cm	1628-29	religious	German	1601-1650
24032-0sposi1.jpg	The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather draperies that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting	MANTEGNA, Andrea	View of the west and north walls	Walnut oil on plaster	1465-74	historical	Italian	1451-1500
24726-embrace.jpg	The Master of Ávila is identified as Garcia del Barco.

23142-3pomegra.jpg	The Madonna and Christ Child appear in a window, and the child is standing on the balustrade below it. She is holding a pomegranate that has been cut open out to him, and the boy has taken some of it, for he is showing Mary red pearls of fruit that he is holding in his clumsy child's hand. Mary appears melancholy, as if she knows about the future Passion of her son, symbolized by the pomegranate.This is one of the first Florentine panel paintings known today to have been produced with a paint medium containing oil for colour pigments. This technique first appeared in northern painting in the first half of the 15th century and rapidly spread there. Italian developed the technique later. The panel is very small by Italian standards, yet not at all an unusual format in Flemish painting. The Christ Child as well, with his fat, tummy overlong torso and skinny little arms, refutes the widespread generally more rounded Florentine type of depiction.This Madonna is modeled after one by Leonardo; in fact, the painting was formerly thought to be an early work by Leonardo	LORENZO DI CREDI	Madonna and Child with a Pomegranate	Oil on panel, 16,5 x 13,4 cm	1475-80	religious	Italian	1451-1500

Lodovico's presentation of the narrative discretely includes all the relevant context of the story, without distracting the viewer from the magnificent figure of Peter in the foreground. In the background we see the palace of  the High Priest, with Christ being brought before him on the arcaded upper story, and the servants warming themselves by a fire on the ground arcade, where Peter had recently been with them.

15203-cecilia.jpg	The painting depicts the appearance of an angel to Valerianus and Cecilia, a young couple who had been converted to Christianity. Cecilia had taken a vow of chastity and had persuaded her husband to do likewise. Valerianus had suspected her of secretly being in love with his f riend Tiburtius but the angelic apparition allays his doubts while also heralding their approaching martyrdom.The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. It represents a high point of his maturity, ranking with the Madonna of the Rosei family and the Annunciation in Turin. The disciplined, orderly construction has a Neoclassical stamp that derives from the artist's Tuscan background. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. The structural elements of the composition are striking: the link between Tibertius' hand and the angel's foot; the alignment of the palm branch and the organ pipes, and the wreath of flowers, St. Cecilia's hand and St. Valerianus' knee; and the parallels formed by the figures of St. Valerianus and St. Cecilia, the organ pipes and the door frame, the keyboard and the dais. Every element is brought into complex play in this highly articulated composition, from the tips of the wings and the palm branch to the edge of the red mantle, St. Valerianus' foot and the velvet cushion.

14989-2ponta04.jpg	This work was probably produced at the beginning of 1894, when Gauguin painted another snowscape, Paris in the Snow (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Van Gogh). During his two years in Paris he painted far fewer works than before - large amounts of his time were taken up with organizing his show at Durand-Ruel's and on a number of literary projects. Consequently, what little he did paint was not new in either subject or treatment. This landscape is remarkably similar to those that he had produced during his Impressionist period - the small brush-strokes are quite different from the broad sweeps of colour that characterized his Tahitian works	GAUGUIN, Paul	Breton Village in the Snow	Oil on canvas, 62 x 87 cm	1894	landscape	French	1851-1900
11595-salome.jpg	Dolci was a painter of intense religiosity. His work was much sought after internationally during his own lifetime and his reputation reached its apogee during the eighteenth century, particularly in England. The meticulous finish, careful elaboration of detail and concentration of expression, especially in those compositions with single figures, are the hallmarks of a style that proved to be influential even in the late eighteenth century in the work, for example, of Jean-Baptiste Greuze.The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-8, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.Dolci painted several versions of Salome. According to Baldinucci, the original version was painted, probably during the 1660s, for the Marchese Rinuccini in Florence and it proved to be the artists most popular work, known through two other variants of good quality (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen and Glasgow, City Museum and Art Gallery), which in turn spawned numerous copies. Of the three versions recorded by Baldinucci, the present painting is the second, which was acquired by Sir John Finch (1626&#151;82) who gave it to Charles II. Finch was the English Resident at the court of the Grand Duke Ferdinand II in Florence from 1665 to 1670.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

03041-07lamen.jpg	Kneeling beneath the crosses of Calvary, the Virgin mourns her Son whose body lies before her. John supports the dead Christ's head, while Mary Magdalene, her long hair flowing, lifts one of His hands to her cheek. Behind John stands Joseph of Arimathaea with an anointing-vessel, and behind the Virgin rises the upright of the bare cross, stained with the blood of the crucified Saviour; on the tree next to it can be seen the bound foot of one of the thieves. Beyond is a rocky landscape with a castle on the edge of a lake.Apart from the Berlin panel, the theme of the Lamentation occurs in only one other painting by Baldung. The picture in the Landesmuseum at Innsbruck, which bears the date 1513 and is clearly an earlier work, is much more constricted, more angular and restless in its composition. In the Berlin painting the dramatic outburst of grief on the part of John and Mary Magdalene has given way to silent resignation. This simplification of the forms and softening of the outline is also apparent in two drawings on the same theme, a sketch in Basel for the Innsbruck painting, which bears the date 1513, and a drawing in a private collection, which is dated 1515. By studying as well two woodcuts on the same subject, the consistent development of Baldung's style from early apprenticeship to the full maturity of the Berlin Lamentation shows up in a telling manner.The artist, whose family came from Swabia, was born at Weyersheim near Strasbourg. At the age of 18 he began his apprenticeship in Dürer's workshop in Nuremberg. It may have been the patricians of the imperial city who later obtained for him the commission for two altarpieces which he completed around 1507 for Halle Cathedral. One, representing the Adoration of the Magi, eventually found its way to the Berlin Gallery. While in Strasbourg, of which town he had become a burgher in 1509, he received the important commission for the high altar in Freiburg Cathedral, whereupon he moved to Freiburg and spent several years there, roughly between 1512 and 1517. It was only towards the end of the second decade, when he had completed this major work, that Baldung seems to have painted the Lamentation, in which one can detect traces of the imposing Freiburg style, a distinct departure from the late-Gothic resonances of the Innsbruck panel.Hardly anything is known about the origins of this picture. At one time it belonged to a private collector in southern France. Wilhelm Bode bought it and presented it to the Berlin Gallery in 1907	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	The Lamentation of Christ	Lime panel, 141,3 x 96 cm	c. 1518	religious	German	1501-1550
31314-altar_1.jpg	This panel belonged to an altarpiece, now dismembered. According to the reconstruction accepted by many scholars, the altarpiece consisted of a Virgin and Child in the centre (Brooklyn Museum, New York), St Augustin (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg) at the left, and probably St Nicholas (lost) at the right. The three predella panels are the Departure of St Augustin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), the Entry of Christ to Jerusalem (Pinacoteca Stuard, Parma), and the Birth of St Nicholas (Kunstmuseum, Basel)	PIETRO DI GIOVANNI D'AMBROGIO	Virigin and Child	Tempera and tooled gold on poplar panel, 98 x 53 cm	1435-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450
26700-lu04azo.jpg	"""Eliakim begat Azor. Azor begat Zadok. Zadok begat Achim."" (Matthew 1:13-14)This is the first lunette on the north wall.The absence of information regarding the figures represented has thwarted any attempt to identify them. On the left a seated woman is shown indicating something outside the lunette to a boy (or a girl) who seems to be engrossed in writing or drawing and turns somewhat hesitantly. The woman's pose, with its great naturalness and self-possession, is a variation on the twisted head, shoulders, and legs of the other figures.On the other side of the lunette, seen sideways on, but with his head turned toward the viewer, sits a solitary mature man, his face furrowed by deep lines. Tightly wrapped in his yellow ochre mantle, from which only his head and an arm emerge, he appears to be prey to distressing thoughts. The body, modelled concisely with great plastic power by the interplay of light and shade, and the pattern of the folds of the mantle, stands out clearly against the background.The number of figures present in this lunette is half that of the first lunettes painted by Michelangelo. This sense of isolation intensifies the expressive power of the figure of the pensive man, which some interpreted as being an imaginary self-portrait of the artist"	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Azor - Zadok	Fresco	1511-12	religious	Italian	1501-1550

33959-sebasti2.jpg	During his career Reni and his workshop produced two types of images of St Sebastian, which exist in various versions. The first type, from around 1615, exists in the autograph work now in the Musei di Strada Nuova, Palazzo Rosso in Genoa. Reni returned to the subject around 1616-17, with a different, larger composition. Many versions exist of this work, the painting in the Dulwich Gallery, London, is most likely the original and first one	RENI, Guido	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas, 127 x 92 cm	c. 1615	religious	Italian	1601-1650
03615-7moses.jpg	Late in his career, Beccafumi executed an important series of paintings for the venerable Cathedral of Pisa. Moses and the Golden Calf is disturbing in its originality because the figures have become increasingly thin, diaphanous, and dependent upon silhouette and outline to achieve convincing form. Scale is unconventional and has little significance by normal usage. Moses, holding the tablets, stands in a contorted pose and looks disapprovingly at the miniaturized golden calf nearby. The sharply foreshortened nude youth in the left foreground is difficult to interpret.	BECCAFUMI, Domenico	Moses and the Golden Calf	Oil on wood, 197 x 139 cm	1536-37	religious	Italian	1501-1550
11120-early11.jpg	Degas's family were related to the Italian aristocracy, among them Baroness Bellelli and Duchess Morbilli. In 1856 he traveled for the first time to Italy, where he intended to make the acquaintance of his Italian relatives. This journey, which was followed by another in 1858 and several more in 1859, was Degas's real education. In Italy, Degas preferred the Quattrocento painters and the exponents of Florentine Mannerism.The people Degas depicted in that time were almost all members of his family, especially his sisters and brothers, and himself. His early portraits achieve their culmination in his group portrait The Bellelli Family.The present painting represents Hilaire de Gas, the painter's grandfather	DEGAS, Edgar	Hilaire de Gas	Oil on canvas, 53 x 41 cm	1857	portrait	French	1851-1900

09741-grif_02.jpg	The reconstruction of the polyptych, dismembered in the 18th century, is not unambiguous. It seems certain that the central panel was the painting of St Vincent Ferrer while on his sides were St Peter and St John the Baptist. Paintings of St Lucy and St John the Baptist were probably located on the upper part of the sides while a Crucifixion tondo was in the upper central position.

11285-307delac.jpg	The capture of Algiers in 1830 had given France the Sultan of Morocco as a neighbour. Louis Philippe's government decided to send him an ambassador extraordinary, the Comte de Mornay; the latter wished to take an official artist with him and chose Eugene Delacroix. The mission left Toulon on 11 January 1832, landed at Tangiers on the 25 January, travelled through a part of Morocco, and returned via Oran and Algiers.During his visit to this country, Delacroix witnessed spectacles belonging to a noble and primitive way of life which provided material for his art until he died; but he had not been allowed to enter the jealously guarded harems of the Moslems. It was the chief harbour engineer at Algiers who persuaded one of the port officials, a former reis or owner of privateers, to allow Delacroix into his own harem.In these few hours Delacroix did several watercolour sketches, some of which are in the Louvre. Using them as a basis, he painted a large picture on his return, and exhibited it in the 1834 salon. He wanted to show the dark tones of flesh and the subdued colours in the warm half-light of the harem.In 1849 he painted another smaller version of the same subject, now in the Musée de Montpellier. Here the colours are softer and the atmosphere more intimate; it has a note of nostalgia absent from the 1834 Salon picture, which is still full of his first impressions, and which already foreshadows Renoir. The latter artist was well aware of this relationship; in 1872 he painted a large picture inspired by Delacroix's canvas and called Les Parisiennes habillées en Algériennes (Tokyo Museum). He had already done an Odalisque and exhibited it in the 1870 Salon. (Chester Dale Collection, New York.)

The figures, delineated with just a few bare contours and dark areas of colour, bear witness to the calm and economy of motion that attracted Rippl-Rónai to the game.

07580-49franci.jpg	The founder of the Franciscan Order was the first person to experience the miracle of stigmatization of his own body. In other words, he was marked out by Christ's wounds. Here he is reduced to the ideal state of penance in the wilderness - a state equally valid for saints and pious people. Caravaggio shows no sign of reinterpreting the story unconventionally. His rather traditional approach may derive from the fact that the composition is probably a commission from the papal family. They owned the township known as Carpineto, from where an almost identical second version, stored at present in the Palazzo Venezia, Rome, originated. Stylistically, the painting is very closely related to the Brera Supper in Emmaus, which was probably painted in Latium.

33006-07farnes.jpg	The conclusion of the Psyche story takes place in two broad format paintings in the vault panel. Raphael places these scenes in an illusionistic tapestry that appears to be hung between the garlands. Thus the artist avoids the extreme foreshortening that would have been required of an illusionistic prospect of the sky in this same place. On the right Raphael depicts the council of the gods in which Jupiter decides to accept Psyche and mercury gives her the drink of immortality. Then the wedding is celebrated in the painting on the left.

27193-levantin.jpg	Hendrik van Minderhout painted a number of large exotic harbour scenes such as this which follow in the tradition of Jan Baptist Weenix and Johannes Lingelbach. He favoured compositions built around a central quay lavishly staffed, with Dutch vessels in the open water to the left and Roman ruins or a steep hill to the right to create a high repoussoir and offset his scenes against a richly coloured early evening sky.The present painting shows a Levantine harbour with a galley and a man-of-war coming in to anchor, together with many figures on shore	MINDERHOUT, Hendrik van	A Levantine Harbour	Oil on canvas, 163 x 243	1681	landscape	Flemish	1651-1700

00029-philocte.jpg	From 1772 Abildgaard spent five years in Rome thanks to a scholarship granted by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It was while in Rome that he created this depiction of the legendary hero Philoctetes, whose screams of pain caused by a festering snakebite made his comrades-in-arms abandon him on a Greek island during the Trojan war.Abildgaard used a principal work of classical sculpture as the basis for his rendition of Philoctetes' tormented state: the Torso Belvedere in the Vatican museum served as the model for the plastic and mannered rendition of the hero's upper body. With this move, Abildgaard's stylistic innovation was imbued with features of a work canonised by neoclassicism - without, however, reducing the tensions in the painting	ABILDGAARD, Nicolai	The Wounded Philoctetes	Oil on canvas, 123 x 178 cm	1775	mythological	Danish	1751-1800

35911-barberin.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the hall in the apartment of Anna Colonna in the north wing of the Palazzo Barberini. It represents the Triumph of Divina Sapientia.The Palazzo Barberini, residence of the papal family Barberini, set a new standard for Roman palace architecture and its painted decoration. Planning for the expansion of the sixteenth-century structure was first undertaken by Carlo Maderno, then transferred after his death to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who here distinguished himself as an architect for the first time.The first commission for the painted decor was given to Andrea Sacchi who in 1629-30 painted the ceiling of the largest room in the wing occupied by Anna Colonna, Taddeo Barberini's wife. Sacchi painted here the fresco identified as Triumph of Divina Sapientia (divine wisdom). Sirens in the room corners hold up small sun disks that extend up into the fresco. They anticipate the theme of the ceiling, in which the sun plays a central role.The design of the ceiling omits architectural elements completely. Viewers find themselves confronted with a startling heavenly vision including, among other things, realistically depicted astronomical bodies - Earth and the sun hand directly above them. The personification of Divine Wisdom is seated on the Solomonic lion throne, crowned by two Barberini bees, before a huge radiating solar disk in yellow-gold. Imaginative cloud formations fill the greater part of the picture surface, creating a perspective pull that graphically suggests the vast distance between the smaller Earth at the bottom edge of the picture and the gigantic sun.It is obvious that Sacchi's ceiling presents a commentary on the then current issue of Galileo Galilei's heliocentric worldview	SACCHI, Andrea	Ceiling fresco	Fresco	1629-30	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

42967-01view.jpg	In 1577 a serious fire in the Palazzo Ducale destroyed the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, originally the meeting place for the Venetian legislature. It necessitated the wholesale renovation of the pictorial decoration, and artists received explicit instructions about subject and even composition, the idea being to emulate the visual authority of the destroyed works as closely as possible.In the redecorated room the thirty-five ceiling canvases, some of them by Veronese, celebrate the glory of Venice allegorically and illustrate the Republic's military history. On the end wall Tintoretto and his pupils painted the enormous representation of Paradise.

23737-gypsy.jpg	Vladimir Yegorovich Makovsky's subject bears heavily on a traditional Russian subject. Gypsy Girl defies the tradition of Romanticism and neo-Classicism, which dominated Russian art in the first half of the nineteenth century. As a founding member of Peredvizhniki, or &#145;The Wanderers', a group of artists who aimed to bring art into life, like their contemporaries in literature and in music, such as Feodor Dostoyevsky and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakoff, respectively, Makovsky's painting is a strong response to Russia's traditional Slavic heritage.

Meanwhile, however, Mary and Joseph had fled to safety with their baby. The senseless slaughter of the innocents is an example of ruthless tyranny. The painting was probably commissioned on behalf of Prince Maurits, whose task as commander-in-chief of the army was to rid the Netherlands of Spanish tyranny.A second version of this subject was made one year later for the city of Haarlem	CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM	Massacre of the Innocents	Oil on canvas, 245 x 358 cm	1590	religious	Dutch	1551-1600
44047-2abegg.jpg	The Abegg Triptych was painted for an Italian gentleman, an unidentified member of the Villa family from Chieri in Piedmont, who were active in banking in the Netherlands. Their coat of arms appears in the glazed window in the left wing. The picture is generally regarded as a late work by one of Rogier's successors, perhaps not painted until the 1460s, though some of the figures of the Crucifixion were copied as early as 1447 by the Hamburg painter Hans Bornemann, who died in 1475. The costume of the donor and the findings from dendrochronological investigation allow us to date the picture to the middle of the 1440s. Compared to figures in works by Rogier's own hand the figures here, particularly in the Crucifixion, seem excessively emotional; instead of radiating dignified grief they are uttering loud cries of lamentation.Once again, the design of the triptych must have been by an assistant in Rogier's workshop. The figure of the red-robed St. John to the left of the Cross shows how he reworked the master's figural types to suit his own ideas. The model is St John in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and it is followed faithfully in such details as the right foot. The folds of the robe, however, are more strongly modeled.The cloak in particular, very dynamically draped and with a large fold flung backward over the shoulder, gives the figure a sense of agitation that is in tune with the character of this painting as a whole, but not with its model. Similarly, Mary Magdalene's cloak slipping down from her hips picks up a motif from the Deposition, but combines it with an extrovert gesture foreign to that picture, with the saint suddenly flinging up her arms.The series of the three panels follows a chronological sequence: the sculptural Annunciation group in the donor's loggia refers to Christ's becoming man; in the central panel Christ has just died, and the sun and moon turn dark as His companions break into loud lamentations; on the right Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and a servant are approaching with a ladder to take the dead body down from the Cross	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Abegg Triptych	Oil on oak panel, 102 x 70,5 cm (central), 103 x 31 cm (each wing)	c. 1445	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

23820-7marine1.jpg	"In the fertile years that followed his Déjeuner and Olympia, Manet experimented very widely. Sometimes he focused on giving form to colour and movement in works like the Bullfight, at others he was inspired by contemporary events, such as the Battle of the ""Kearsarge"" and the ""Alabama"" off Cherbourg. This episode of the American War of Independence made a considerable impression on public opinion. The work testified to Manet's modernity, but was also an attempt to renew the theme of naval combat traditional in Dutch painting.

34223-st_paul.jpg	The seventeenth century was a very productive period for Spanish painting. Spain's extensive trade links brought with them an interchange of artistic ideas, particularly with Italy. Jusepe de Ribera played an important role in this. He began his studies with Ribalta but left Spain early on and went to Italy, where he discovered the work of Caravaggio. His style is characterized by strong light and shade, together with a realistic portrayal even of religious themes, as seen in his St Paul the Hermit of 1647	RIBERA, Jusepe de	St Paul the Hermit	Oil on canvas, 130 x 104 cm	1647	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

16929-death_v0.jpg	The major painting of Van der Goes's third period (between around 1478 and 1482) and very likely one of the last works he painted is the Death of the Virgin. The panel is almost square in shape. The scene is set in a totally enclosed room. The apostles are grouped around Mary's bed. The Virgin's fine blue robe contrast with the purple sheets that cover the bed. Her livid gray face is framed by the immaculate whiteness of her wimple, and of the cushion on which her head rests. Her hands are joined, her fingers look quite bony. Her eyes have lost their lustre. She looks up one last time towards the heavens, where her Son appears to her in His glory with arms outstretched, to display the wounds in his hands. He is dressed in a blue robe and a large red cloak held up by two angels. The picture represents the moment at which life has already gently slipped away, but death has not yet completed its work.The painter uses the apostles to ring the changes on the different varieties of grief, and their profound sadness contrasts with the detachment of the Virgin herself. Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause. This work, like all those he painted during his last period, represents the eruption of sacred experience into a profane world. The artist achieves this through an abundant use of colours which strike the viewer as unreal, as if they were themselves transfigured. In this way, Van der Goes seeks to identify his painting with the mystery of transcendence itself.To this end too, the gestures of his figures are emphatic. He uses techniques or the progressive reduction of pictorial space and the transformation of figures, which he paints half-length, not full length	GOES, Hugo van der	The Death of the Virgin	Oil on wood, 147,8 x 122,5 cm	c. 1480	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

04806-cremona4.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the façade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the façade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht Dürer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy Dürer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the Meeting at the Golden Gate, the tender embrace of Joachim and Anna is united by the arch of the gate over their heads.

Its dedication relates to King Olaf II of Norway (995-1030). it was extensively rebuilt during the 14th century. The tower has been hit by lightning around ten times, and the whole church has burned down three times throughout its known existence.The picture, which positions the viewer in a hamlet just outside the city gates, is dotted with figures illustrative of village life, and overshadowed by the imposing silhouette of St. Olav's which dominates the town around it.

35944-2nieuwe.jpg	"Saenredam dedicated his entire artistic career to the genre of architectural painting. His pictures featured only real buildings, notable landmarks of various Dutch towns. One of these buildings was the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) in Haarlem, built between 1646 and 1649 according to the design by Jacob van Campen. Saenredam made several drawings and paintings of the church shortly after construction was completed. Based on the construction drawings made earlier, the painting includes certain architectural elements which featured in the plan but were never actually implemented.The puritanical Protestant church interior is decorated only by the brass candelabra suspended from the ceiling and by the colourful coats of arms on the windows and ceiling.The painting is signed and dated on the plinth of the right column: ""P.

03068-hersemer.jpg	Ovid (Met. 2:708-832) tells how three sisters, returning from the festival of Minerva and carrying her sacred baskets on their heads, were espied by Mercury who immediately fell in love with the most beautiful of them, Herse. Another of the sisters, Aglauros, was consumed with envy, and tried to prevent Mercury entering Herse's chamber when he came to her one night. He touched Aglauros with his wand and she turned to black stone, the colour of her thoughts.The present playful and sensuous representation of the story is similar both in style and theme to a number of others executed by van Balen and his circle.

13020-porziaim.jpg	During his trip to Italy and in particular when he was living in Genoa, Anthony van Dyck painted many portraits of members of patrician families. These were strongly influenced by those that Peter Paul Rubens had produced for the same families almost two decades earlier. From these Van Dyck borrowed the structures and the chromatic oppositions between the dark, court clothing and the bright ruffs, embroideries and jewels. The painting in the Brussels museum is a good example of this type of official representation.Porzia Imperiale and her daughter Maria Francesca belonged to a family of Genoese bankers. On 5 August 1610 the mother married Bartolomeo Imperiale, probably a distant cousin. Born in around 1586, she must have been between 35 and 40 when Anthony van Dyck stayed in Genoa. Maria Francesca's date of birth is not known, but the inscription Virtute gaudet (she rejoices in virtue) on the virginal, exalting the young girl's honour, shows that she was of marriageable age. Women occupied a special place in the Republic of Genoa. It is therefore not surprising to see them associated with Virtue, a quality with heroic connotations that is more generally ascribed to men.Porzia Imperiale, seated here, is dressed in a black gown, its severity softened by an imposing ruff, a double chain, engraved buttons and lace-edged cuffs. In her left hand she carries a closed fan, whilst her right hand rests on the arm of the chair. Her daughter wears a light-coloured gown with silvery reflections, decorated with gilded braid and a ruff, its moiré reflections very finely balancing the dark mass of her mother's gown. Porzia Imperiale's determined face contrasts with Maria Francesca's gentle and innocent looks. The background architectural details and the heavy red drapery confer a monumental aspect to the painting, further accentuated by the way in which the figures literally dominate the spectator, who views them from a low-angle position. The subtlety with which Van Dyck renders the different dark nuances is proof of an uncommon skill	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of Porzia Imperiale and Her Daughter	Oil on canvas, 184,5 x 134 cm	c. 1628	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
10011-herdemo1.jpg	This painting and its companion piece, Cheerful Democritus, depict two men with diametrically opposed views of the world. The subjects of the paintings are the Greek philosophers Democritus of Abdera and Heraclitus of Ephesus.  Their views of life could not have been more different:  Democritus never stopped laughing at the follies of humankind while Heraclitus wept continuously over the condition of the world. There are numerous representations of them in Greek and Roman art and literature, but the theme fell out of favour in post-classical art and was not revived until the late 15th century. By about 1600 Democritus and Heraclitus once again became a popular subject, particularly in the Netherlands, and the philosophers are depicted either in pairs or a single composition.

32444-concert2.jpg	Mattia Preti's Concert is a work which has a bearing on the artistic links between Italy and the Netherlands. Its style is strongly influenced by Caravaggio, particularly in its formal aspects: the strong chiaroscuro reaches an extreme degree in the faces of the three figures. At the same time, the painting also demonstrates the interest in depicting everyday life so characteristic of the art of northern Europe, and takes pleasure in painting the details of the clothing and objects.The composition of the scene and the descending ray of light that isolates the three youths in the darkness reflect the influence of the tavern and gambling scenes painted by Bartolomeo Manfredi and Valentin de Boulogne and other early followers of Caravaggio	PRETI, Mattia	The Concert	Oil on canvas, 107 x 145 cm	c. 1635	genre	Italian	1651-1700

This is probably the last known vanitas still-life executed by the artist. Although Claesz. started painting vanitas still-lifes in the 1620s the majority of his works in this genre were executed in the 1650s. During the last decade of his life he favoured grander, more detailed compositions in contrast to his earlier sober style	CLAESZ., Pieter	Vanitas Still-Life	Oil on canvas, 50 x 65 cm	1659-60	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
16731-sleeping.jpg	This painting was for a long time considered to be the work of Girolamo Savoldo. However, the attribution to Girolamo Treviso is now unanimously accepted.

39134-02zianig.jpg	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo decorated with frescoes the family villa at Zianigo which his father, Giovanni Baptista Tiepolo had bought on his return from the task of decorating the Prince-Bishop's palace in Würzburg and which he had restored and altered to his own needs. The frescoes were painted over a fairly long period of time: between 1759 - the date shown on one of the monochrome scenes from the chapel - and 1797 - according to a now lost inscription read at the beginning of the twentieth century in a mural scene in the Pulcinella Room. Almost all the frescoes in the small Zianigo villa were detached in 1906 and in 1936 they were moved to the Ca' Rezzonico and placed in small rooms, in a recomposition that closely repeats the original one, though with some differences and overlapping.The frescoes in the villa depict the stories of Pulcinella (also Punchinello, a classical character that originated in the Commedia dell'arte of the 17th century), scenes of villa life, games, the wars and affections of satyrs and fauns. It is a comprehensive cycle which Giovanni Domenico painted for himself in successive stages in the non-monumental rooms of the country house. When completed, the whole Zianigo work was a kind of grand recapitulation of many aspects and idiosyncrasies of Giovanni Domenico's art, while also representing the cultural passing of a period and a style. It is almost a pictorial testament which, while valuing the past, did not conceal the drama of the present nor the uncertainty of the future	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Domenico	View of the Pulcinella Room	Fresco	1759-97	interior	Italian	1751-1800
26068-18portra.jpg	The tightly framed composition of this portrait makes it one of the most compact images ever painted by Memling. The solid head occupies virtually the entire width of the painting, with more than half of the shoulders and hands cut off the edge. The sensation of extreme proximity is exceptionally strong. The viewpoint is so low that the flat landscape, with a little church in the distance, can barely be discerned above the subject's shoulders, while his head stands out monumentally against the sky. The broadly drawn, wispy clouds appear to be a later addition. The man wears a dark jacket lined with white fur, flecked with brown, and an asymmetrical collar over a red waistcoat. The wider right lapel is folded over, and if fastened would reach high above its counterpart. A small crucifix set with pearls hangs from a golden chain, half beneath and half on top of the collar. The young man in London's National Gallery has a similar piece of jewellery, which he wears in the same way. It must have been a common ornament, because a version of it also appears in the Bruges Portrait of a young woman and in the allegorical figure of a girl in New York. The man's devotion is evidently directed towards a lost representation, probably of the Virgin and Child.When closed, this diptych would have displayed the coat-of-arms that is still to be found on the reverse. The man probably belonged to the Lespinette family (Franche-Comté). Since its auction (as a work by Antonello da Messina) in 1894, the painting has been accepted as a Memling. It is generally compared with his portraits from the 1480s, and shows a particular similarity in its modelling to the Bruges Portrait of a young woman of 1480.It is understandable that some people should have been inclined to attribute this admirable portrait to Antonello, such is its precision and assurance of drawing and modelling of the face; but in the features, which are as though engraved, and the pointed steeple visible in the background, give a Flemish character of this picture	MEMLING, Hans	Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape	Oil on oak panel, 30 x 22 cm	c. 1480	portrait	Flemish	1451-1500
10989-213david.jpg	If little else were known of David, the self-portrait that he painted in May 1791 certainly looks the image of a Romantic. Painted rapidly, with a spontaneous touch, it shows an excited, even wild young man, with freely curling hair, eyes aglow with almost visionary zeal. He is looking slightly dishevelled and with a piercing gaze, very different from the normally relaxed pose of his sitters and perhaps an indication of the internal conflicts that eventually led him to become a fully committed Republican	DAVID, Jacques-Louis	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas, 64 x 53 cm	1791	portrait	French	1801-1850
07498-22barber.jpg	The still undeveloped features of this young cleric, who later became Pope Urban VIII (1623-1644) were portrayed as a much more distinguished figure by the skills of Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680). Here, the face appears in chiaroscuro against a neutral background in such a way that a wall appears to be screening off the figure from the left. In order to give the figure more 'rilievo', or more three-dimensionality, the lit sections are painted against a dark, and the sections in shadow against a light, background	CARAVAGGIO	Portrait of Maffeo Barberini	Oil on canvas, 124 x 90 cm	1599	portrait	Italian	1551-1600

42079-jacob.jpg	In this painting Varotari depicts a scene from the biblical story of Jacob. It shows Jacob telling Rachel and Leah that he wishes to leave Laban's service. Jacob urges Rachel and Leah to leave with him.According to the Bible, Leah becomes Jacob's wife through a deception on the part of her father, Laban. In the Biblical account, Jacob is dispatched to the hometown of Laban - the brother of his mother Rebekah - to avoid being killed by his brother Esau, and to find a wife. Out by the well, he encounters Laban's younger daughter Rachel tending her father's sheep, and decides to marry her. Laban is willing to give Rachel's hand to Jacob as long as he works seven years for her. On the wedding night, however, Laban switches Leah for Rachel. Later Laban claims that it is uncustomary to give the younger daughter away in marriage before the older one. Laban offers to give Rachel to Jacob in marriage in return for another seven years of work. Jacob accepts the offer and marries Rachel after the week-long celebration of his marriage to Leah	VAROTARI, Dario the Elder	Scene from the Story of Jacob	Oil on canvas, 63 x 138 cm	-	religious	Italian	1551-1600
13660-adorati.jpg	The Adoration of the Magi, is one of the fourteen panels from the altarpiece of the Chancel in Viseu Cathedral, and the earliest dated work of the artist. It  is a key work in the evaluation of the impact which the painting and the painters from southern parts of the Low Countries had on the taste of patrons and on the work of painters in Portugal. Despite the controversy surrounding its authorship, everything points to a team, led by the Flemish painter Francisco Henriques, joined locally by the young Vasco Fernandes, elaborating the altarpiece for the bishop of Viseu.The Adoration of the Magi includes iconographic details which confirm that the altarpiece was made locally.  The black Wise King, Balthasar, is replaced by an Indian from Brazil. The closeness in time of this artistic representation (the first in Western art) to the discovery of the lands of the True Cross (Brazil) gives it an extraordinary historical value	FERNANDES, Vasco	Adoration of the Magi	Oil on wood, 132 x 79 cm	1501-06	religious	Portuguese	1501-1550
26601-2ceil_ve.jpg	"In planning the architectural design Michelangelo first had to accommodate his program to the pre-existing building, including the windows, which were the source of light for his decoration. The wreath of openings still provides the principal viewing light.Michelangelo devised a long central area framed by a fictive marble cornice and separated into nine sections by broad pilaster strips bent across the ceiling, also in imitation white marble. Sections of alternating dimensions are framed between wider and narrower bands. Within them Michelangelo varied the size of the actual narratives, giving only the smaller ones a marble frame. Four ignudi (male nudes), among the most admired elements of the ceiling, ostensibly support ribbons attached to large medallions painted to look like bronze. Twenty in all, they are in different poses, producing, together with the Prophets and Sibyls, a ""handbook"" of alternatives for the seated figure for later artists.At the corners of the ceiling Michelangelo has painted four salvation subjects, including David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes. Triangular-shaped compartments are repeated in a continuous band along the entire border of the ceiling; they contain bronze-colored nudes that alternate with the renowned Prophets and Sibyls set into marble thrones which, in turn, have paired marble putti in a variety of poses and positions that expand upon the tradition of Donatello and Luca della Robbia.

26107-29jerome.jpg	This small panel was only discovered relatively recently (1945) and so does not feature in most of the Memling literature. Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach. The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden. It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw. The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention. The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane. It is related to the more modest little arches in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love. The fairly heavily dotted little trees in the background also recall that work.The odd way the image is cropped to the left and right is not the result of its having been narrowed at some stage, but is in fact deliberate. The angled position of the arch might indicate that this was once a left wing. The panel has been cut off at the top and bottom. Considering the size of the figure and the wooded landscape, it could be a side panel for the St Jerome in Basel	MEMLING, Hans	St Jerome and the Lion	Oil on oak panel, 37 x 24,5 cm	1485-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

11942-zenobi02.jpg	The core element around which the rooms of the Zenobio palace are organized is the large double-story main hall (ballroom) complete with an orchestra balcony, and embellished with complex stucco work created by Abbondio Stazio sometime later than the frescoes. Twelve personifications of the Arts and Sciences, among them the nine Muses, sit on imaginary stools along the cornice that circles the walls of the room. The ceiling opens wide, exploding into an ornate projecting cornice that rests on large, bulging corbels. The large elliptical opening frames a view of the sky containing an allegorical depiction of Aurora. The entire ceiling is punctuated by displays of flowers and fruit.

03044-09mucius.jpg	Mucius Scaevola (Livy 2:12-13) was a hero of Roman legend. When the Etruscan forces, led by Lars Porsena, king of Clusium, were besieging Rome, a young Roman nobleman, Caius Mucius, succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines in disguise, meaning to kill Porsena. By mistake he killed the king's secretary who was sitting beside him. Mucius was seized but, to show how cheaply he held his life, thrust his right hand into the flames of an altar fire and let it burn. Porsena, amazed by his endurance, set him free. He was thereafter called Scaevola, meaning 'left-handed'.In painting, of the Renaissance and later, Mucius stands for the virtues of patience and constancy. His sacrifice was also held to be a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Mucius Scaevola	Lime wood, 98 x 68 cm	1531	historical	German	1501-1550
39056-4virgil1.jpg	The third room on the ground floor of the Palazzina was painted by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo with scenes after Virgil's Aeneid, depicting the legend of Aeneas.

15167-13quarat.jpg	This panel is part of the predella of the Quaratesi polyptych.It appears that Gentile felt freer to experiment in the minor scenes of a predella than in the main panel of an altarpiece. In this case he shows the interior of a church, which itself was quite a difficult task, with a rather convincing treatment of the space	GENTILE DA FABRIANO	Quaratesi Polyptych: Miracle of the Pilgrims at St Nicholas's Tomb	Tempera on panel, 36 x 35 cm	1425	religious	Italian	1351-1400

20956-holyfami.jpg	Jan van Kessel painted the Holy Family within a frame formed by a gray, oval cartouche with floral garlands. Originally from Antwerp, Van Kessel specialised in painting flowers and insects and tiny animals. Here it is noticeable that Mary, Christ and Joseph have been portrayed rather less meticulously than the various flowers. Indeed, Van Kessel may have asked another artist to paint the figures	KESSEL, Jan van, I	Holy Family	Oil on panel, 64 x 50 cm	1660s	still-life	Flemish	1651-1700
43479-mancini4.jpg	Ortensia Mancini (1646-1699), was the fourth of the five celebrated Mancini Sisters (Laure, Olympe, Marie, Marie Anne and Ortensia), daughters of the sister of Cardinal Mazarin, the chief advisor of the young King Louis XIV of France and reputed lover of his mother, Anne of Austria. After their father's death in 1650, the Mancini girls were brought to France by their mother, who hoped that her brother would help find rich and titled husbands for her brood of girls.The five Mancini girls were to become the talk of Paris thanks to their sumptuous dark haired, olive skinned beauty and wild, flamboyant manners, with the young Ortensia (Hortense in Paris), her uncle's favourite niece being the most badly behaved of them all as she grew up into a bold eyed beauty, who was absolutely impossible to resist.At the age of fifteen Hortense was married to one of the richest men in all Europe, the Duc de Meilleraye, with the couple being declared Duc and Duchesse de Mazarin after their wedding day	VOET, Jacob Ferdinand	Portrait of Ortensia Mancini	Oil on canvas, 73 x 57 cm	-	portrait	Flemish	1651-1700
05653-cupidedu.jpg	"In this painting Boucher presents the mythological family where mother Venus and father Mercury are captured in a moment of parental responsibility.

27061-maurits1.jpg	In 1607 the Delft city fathers commissioned the Delft portraitist Michiel van Miereveld to paint a portrait of the Dutch stadholder Prince Maurits (1567-1625). Van Miereveld went to The Hague to record his subjects's features and produced this portrait of the prince in armour, with sword and baton, representing his role as captain general of the Dutch army. This picture became the model for all the later portraits of the prince. (A full-length version of this portrait from 1615-20 is now in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.) The portrait was engraved by Jan Muller in 1608and, like countless copies from Van Mireveld's workshop, hung in homes throughout the Netherlands.

16472-4crucif2.jpg	The crucifix was first attributed to Giotto by Lorenzo Ghiberti, who in his Commentaries quoted other works of the master in the altars of the church of Ognissanti, like the Virgin of Ognissanti and the Dormitio Virginis. Originally it was probably located on the presbytery, dominating the nave and the faithful, near the Virgin of Ognissanti.In poor condition, it was kept in a room adjacent to the basilica and attributed to an artist close to Giotto and possessing great pictorial capacities.The work was restored from 2005 onwards by Opificio delle pietre dura from Florence and was attributed to Giotto himself, for a date which is around 1315. On November 6, 2010, the crucifix was reinstalled inside the left transept, enhanced by proper illumination.Intended for the procession, it is in conformity with the monumental representations of Christ in the cross of the time, namely: the Christ on the cross is in the suffering position; the body falling; the belly prominent on its perizonium; the head leaning forward touching the shoulder; the prominent ribs; the bloody wounds; the superimposed feet.The crucifix has small panels with scenes on the ends of the cross: the Virgin Mary on the left clothed in blue, St John on the right, hands clasped, and on top the titulus in red is surmounted by a blessing Christ accompanied by the Book. The background contains patterned gold behind the body of Christ.The cleaning and retouching of the blackened cross has revealed individual brush strokes and the bright colour of the lapis lazuli used by the artist. This expensive pigment now dominates the background of the work.

24779-portrait.jpg	The sitter probably was Robert de Masmines, a distinguished Burgundian soldier, identifiable on the basis of a drawing now in Arras.

34210-diogenes.jpg	The most famous of the Cynics, the philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, who died in 323 BC, is provided here with a lamp by way of an attribute. According to his own statement, he used it in broad daylight to find a 'genuine person' on a bustling marketplace. The subject was much loved throughout Baroque Europe, although it appears that the Italians preferred to depict the philosopher alone, as with this and another painting by Ribera, while the densely populated scenes were more popular in the Netherlands.Ribera was interested in studying different types of people, and even his religious paintings seem to be populated with figures taken from the everyday world about him, in the tradition of Caravaggio. The subject of this portrait must have prompted this depiction of an eccentric outsider, his hair tangled, his beard unkempt, his hands work-worn, dressed in simple apparel, and directing a penetrating gaze at the beholder	RIBERA, Jusepe de	Diogenes	Oil on canvas, 76 x 61 cm	1637	historical	Spanish	1601-1650
14480-410fried.jpg	This painting, depicting an area of pastureland crossed by tree-lined avenues just outside Dresden, portrayed in masterly fashion from an alienating angle, is an example of Friedrich's final phase of full mastery. He uses an exquisite palette to evoke a particularly solemn evening mood and thereby lends a rhythmic impulse to the foreground with rivulets of water glinting in the sunset. With the richness of its palette, the beauty of its composition and its sonorous atmosphere, this impressive painting is a true masterpiece in the history of European landscape painting	FRIEDRICH, Caspar David	The Grosse Gehege near Dresden	Oil on canvas, 73,5 x 102,5 cm	c. 1832	landscape	German	1801-1850
05786-portrait.jpg	"In Rome the young Bourdon was exposed to some of the greatest portraits of the Renaissance in the collections there, as well as to the constant experiments of artists as diverse as Bernini, Lanfranco and Domenichino, who all painted portraits. from all these influences Bourdon compounded his own style, which inevitably became a formula, but a successful one. He often painted his sitters three-quarters on, in a soft and even light, and preferred waist-length portraits and a feeling of relative informality. With his curious mixture of Italian influences, Bourdon set the style for middle-class French portraiture for almost the rest of the century. One of the best examples is his Portrait of a Man at Montpellier, which is a ""tour de force"" of subtle modelling and lighting. Indeed, almost all the surviving middle-class portraits of the time in France, that are not by Philippe de Champaigne and his followers, copy this type.The sitter of this portrait is unknown"	BOURDON, Sébastien	Portrait of a Man	Oil on canvas, 105 x 65 cm	-	portrait	French	1601-1650
23120-12enthro.jpg	This altarpiece was painted for the church of San Francesco in Pistoia, where remained until 1799, to be transferred in the Uffizi Gallery. Among the latest work of Pietro Lorenzetti, the picture shows the tender motif of the silent colloquy that binds Mother and Child, which is characteristic of the style of other contemporary masters, as Giotto or the sculptor Giovanni Pisano. The predella paintings, described by Vasari, are lost.The painting was restored several times since the 18th century, originally it was higher. The painting is signed and dated on the step of the throne: PETRUS LAURENTII DE SENIS ME PINXIT ANNO DOMINI MCCCXL	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Madonna Enthroned with Angels	Tempera on wood, 145 x 122 cm	1340	religious	Italian	1301-1350
42849-12deadch.jpg	Veronese's images of the Lamentation (he painted several versions of this subject) often convey a haunting reminder of a happy world, thereby increasing the pathos of the Passion. In this painting the heightened sensibility is achieved by the shocking contrast between flashes of elegant drapery (the angels' suavely tinted attire) and Christ still-beautiful, abused flesh. Such calculated inconsistency can make suffering far more moving than a more predictable, uniform pall	VERONESE, Paolo	Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels	Oil on canvas, 110 94 cm	1587-89	religious	Italian	1551-1600
38897-stair1.jpg	On the ceiling of the staircase the image of Time Revealing Truth and Casting Out Envy is depicted.

A bow and arrow are set on them in the foreground, the tip of the arrow tucked into the folds of the spread.The most plausible names scholars have advanced so far for the attribution of the work are Orazio Riminaldi and Giovanni Battista Caracciolo.

12060-young_gi.jpg	This panel depicts a young girl at a window ledge with a cat and a mouse-trap, a hung duck and a pewter ewer beside her.Dou's genre paintings are often imbued with subtle emblematic meanings which would certainly not have been lost on his public. In 17th-century paintings, and in particular in Dou's own work, certain everyday objects took on other meanings and were therefore chosen by the artist for a specific reason: a set of scales, for example, could allude to the virtues of moderation and temperance; an empty bird-cage was a conventional symbol of immorality; and the open mouse-trap and lascivious expression of the cat in this painting could equally have carried some erotic overtones	DOU, Gerrit	Young Girl at a Window Ledge	Oil on panel, 33 x 25 cm	c. 1672	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700
29136-portr_ab.jpg	Numerous portraits have been attributed to Jan Mostaert. These range from those of ancient nobility to lesser Dutch aristocrats and burghers. The royal portraits are all copies after originals painted for Margaret of Austria, but the others are taken from life and then imbued with an aristocratic flavour through the settings. Such is the case in the present portrait where a coat of arms in the architecture and the initials on the cushion beneath his hands identify the sitter, who was a knight of a well-known Haarlem family	MOSTAERT, Jan	Portrait of Abel van den Colster	Panel, 90 x 56 cm	1500-10	portrait	Dutch	1501-1550

09665-1stufa3.jpg	"The picture shows one of the scenes in the Stanza della Stufa. A Roman general distributes the spoils of war to his soldiers, who have proven their valour in combat. In the foreground, a group of prisoners in chains is huddled next to a bundle of trophies. According to Ovid, people in the Age of Bronze may have been wild and combative, but they were neither cruel nor immoral.The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641.

10289-03young3.jpg	The painting has a companion piece depicting the Portrait of a Clean-Shaven Young Man. Both half-length figures are placed close to the picture surface against a bright green background. The close attachment of the two people is suggested in their dress: they wear similar caps, his adorned with stitching, hers with a round agrafe. The freshness  of the observation and the finesse of its realisation recall Netherlandish portraits of the period, such as those of Joos van Cleve and Quentin Massys, for example	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil and tempera on red beechwood, 59 x 41 cm	1522	portrait	German	1501-1550

20475-sacrific.jpg	A particularly accomplished draughtsman, Empoli (actually Jacopo Chimenti) presents us here with an austere composition, one which succeeds in avoiding the least hint of sentimentalism, yet is nonetheless psychologically charged.

03532-prodigal.jpg	In his small painting depicting the biblical tale about the prodigal son Baumgartner not only used the rocaille as a frame, but as a motif in itself.

35682-benthei.jpg	During the years from about 1650 to about 1655, the heroic quality of Ruisdael's landscapes increases. The forms become larger and more massive. Giant oaks and beeches as well as shrubs acquire an unprecedented abundance and fullness. Colours become more vivid, space increases in both height and depth, and there is an emphasis on the tectonic structure of the compositions. He strove to achieve heroic effects without sacrificing the individuality of a single tree or bush. An outstanding example of this tendency is his mighty view of Bentheim Castle.Ruisdael visited Bentheim, a small town in Wesphalia near the Dutch-German border, when he travelled to the region with his friend Berchem in the early fifties. Bentheim's castle is, in fact, on an unimposing low hill, but in his painting Ruisdael enlarged it into a wooded mountain providing the castle with a commanding position. His invention is a superb expression of his aggrandizement of solid forms during this phase. The dense mass of the mountain, obliquely stretching away into depth, and the coulisses on either side of the front edge of the painting are reminiscent of compositional schemes used by the generation of his teachers, but the spatial clarity is new, as are the strong colours, the energy of the brushwork, and the way he unifies the close view of a nearly overwhelming wealth of detail with the most distant parts of the landscape into a consistent whole.

33600-05group.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 410.Probably Rembrandt's most famous and most controversial painting was given its erroneous title the Night Watch in the early 19th century. The title referred to the subdued lighting and led art critics to seek all manner of hidden mysteries in the painting. The original title, recorded in the still extant family chronicle of Captain Banning Cocq, together with a sketch of the painting, sounds rather dry by comparison: ""Sketch of the painting from the Great Hall of Cleveniers Doelen, in which the young Heer van Purmerlandt [Banning Cocq], as captain, orders his lieutenant, the Heer van Vlaerderdingen [Willem van Ruytenburch], to march the company out.""It is, therefore, a ""Doelen"" piece or group portrait in which the captain can be seen in the foreground wearing black and the lieutenant wearing yellow. What sets Rembrandt's group portrait apart from other comparable paintings is his use of chiaroscuro as a dramatic device. Interpretations seeking a plausible action fail to take into account that the scenery is made up more or less of individual ""types"". The painting includes the entire repertoire of portrait poses and gestures from Rembrandt's store of figures.There is inevitably a sense of celebration in the portrayal of individuals in a Dutch group painting. Yet whereas Frans Hals, for example, draws together his individual participants around a banquet scene, Rembrandt breaks up the group, so that individual characters and participants become absorbed in their own actions, each standing alone"	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	The Nightwatch	Oil on canvas, 363 x 437 cm	1642	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

What is noticeable about the voluminous treatment of the robes is the tapering folds of the red cloaks worn by Walpurgis, Mary, John, Augustine and Christ. They all end in an unusually sharp-edged jagged line. This provides a peculiar contrast to the forms otherwise employed in the garments and the bodies of the figures, which are undulating and gently rounded.This example illustrates the exceptional form of Romanesque painting known as the German ""zigzag style,"" or sometimes ""jagged style.""

11323-511delac.jpg	Delacroix's treatment of subjects from fashionable works frequently raised critical hackles, and he was assailed in the name of good taste, the Beautiful, and the Ideal. A notable victim of such disparagement was the scene drawn from Scott's Ivanhoe.

10539-land_oak.jpg	This painting is as much a tree portrait as a landscape study, as the sensitivity and naturalism of the painting imbues the subject with a great deal of character. John Crome, along with John Constable, was one of the earliest English artists to represent identifiable species of trees, rather than generalised forms. His works, renowned for their originality and vision, were inspired by direct observation of the natural world combined with a comprehensive study of Old Masters.

36850-st_peter.jpg	In his years in Italy, Gerard Seghers conformed to the ideas of the 'Tenebrosi'. After his return to Antwerp he could take full advantage of the fashionable interest in Caravaggist painting, which had become an international phenomenon. He became celebrated for his monumental half-length genre scenes. But he was highly regarded in the 1620s for his large religious and allegorical pictures, conceived in a genre style, and mostly done in landscape format. These paintings, such as the Denial of St Peter, contain scenes with numerous characters, depicted with lively poses and facial expressions, grouped compactly together against an undefined background; they are painted half-length or are cut off by the edge of the painting. The concealed candlelight casts a flickering and sharply contrasting gleam on the multi-coloured, theatrical clothing of the figures creating a powerful dramatic effect.These Caravaggist group compositions differ only in subject from contemporary secular genre paintings and just like them are ultimately derived from the compositions of Caravaggio's pupil Bartolomeo Manfredi. There is also a strong relationship with the style of Gerrit van Honthorst of Utrecht, who must have known Seghers in Rome	SEGHERS, Gerard	Denial of St Peter	Oil on canvas, 123 x 161 cm	1620s	religious	Flemish	1601-1650

For Strozzi the main means of expression is colour, so bright and rich compared to his other paintings that it seems an eloquent metaphor for the end to the old man's blindness.This painting, a biblical story depicted as a genre scene, is one of the several versions of this subject painted by Bernardo Strozzi	STROZZI, Bernardo	The Healing of Tobit	Oil on canvas, 158 x 224 cm	c. 1635	religious	Italian	1601-1650

He painted frescoes in the sacristy of San Carlo ai Catinari and a Fall of the Angels now in the Galleria Palatina (Palazzo Pitti) in Florence. One of his pupils was a juvenile Pietro da Cortona who moved to Rome and became one of the towering figures of the Italian Baroque.

14184-08bolt.jpg	At first sight, this painting describing the feminine resistance preceding abandon, might seem to belong to the same vein of light-hearted, erotic themes that Fragonard was fond of throughout his career.

35406-08assum.jpg	The Antwerp Cathedral was given a new marble high altar during the baroque refurbishment that reached a peak around the beginning of the 17th century. Rubens, by then the most famous artist of his day, was commissioned to paint an altarpiece.The image of the Assumption of the Virgin does not derive from the Bible but from an ecclesiastical tradition that took shape in the Middle Ages. By the 16th century, it had become a popular theme. The depiction of the Virgin, with her fluttering robe and swirling head-dress, is graceful and lively. She is borne up to heaven in a cloud by playful putti. Two angels at the top left of the painting are about to crown her with a garland of roses. The twelve apostles stand around her sarcophagus at the bottom. The three women who, according to legend, laid out the Virgin's body are also included. The attractive woman in the middle, wearing a red dress, is given greater prominence than the other bystanders. Her features are those of Rubens' wife, Isabella Brant, who died in June 1626, while the artist was working on this painting	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on panel, 490 x 325 cm	1626	religious	Flemish	1601-1650

41294-10ladisl.jpg	Of the Hungarian kings St Ladislas is perhaps the one most often represented in post-medieval frescoes, altar paintings and statues. In the Middle Ages he was associated with the ideal of chivalry and the legends which gathered around him determined the manner of his representation. Thus the knightly armour and the battle-axe have become permanent attributes, in addition to the crown and the orb.The painting illustrated here, dating from the late sixteenth century, is only superficially linked with medieval portraits of St. Ladislas. The king is shown seated on a throne wearing an ample, richly embroidered cloak studded with pearls round the hem. In the foreground is a voluted and foiled shield with the national emblem, stylized in harmony with the throne. The background is designed to suggest the interior of a Renaissance palace. Through opening on either side of the wall behind the throne - draped with embroidered hangings - there is a view of landscape. A similar motif was often used to fill in the background in north Italian Madonna paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The monochrome landscape on the left is a topographic reference to one of St. Ladislas' most important church activities, the foundation of the Cathedral in Nagyvárad, while the one on the right shows his legendary defeat of the Cumanian abductor. This evocation of two popular episodes from the story of the king's life is intended partly to identify St. Ladislas as a rule of worldly power, and partly to indicate the ideal unity of the Christian king and the Christian knight.St Ladislas is shown as a historical personage, without a halo - a fact indicating that the painting was destined for a secular building. The episodes from the king's life or, to be mere accurate, from legends associated with his name, are treated as historical facts. The same approach characterized the series of prints of royalty and other notabilities which became so popular all Europe in the course of the sixteenth century. It may be assumed that such prints served as models for the painted portrait of St. Ladislas and the two related pictures of St. Stephen and St Emeric	UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian	Saint Ladislaus, King of Hungary	Oil on wood, 103 x 101,3 cm	c. 1600	religious	Hungarian	1551-1600

Mary is being crowned by Christ, while God the Father touches His Son's shoulder with his left hand.

14376-worship.jpg	In the same period when the most talented artists in the country had gathered around Rubens in Antwerp, there were also other artists working in Antwerp who still clung to the taste of Rubens' predecessors. One of these was Frans II Francken, who painted Rockox's 'constcamer'. He was a very popular artist in his time, and although he lacked any outstanding imaginative power or great technical skill, his fame rests on his ability to convert monumental subjects from large-scale art works to proportions more suitable for private houses. The Worship of the Golden Calf is a typical example of the many religious and mythological scenes he painted	FRANCKEN, Frans II	Worship of the Golden Calf	Oil on panel, 60 x 88 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
24776-annuncia.jpg	"Based on its style the Annunciation is attributed to the Master of Flémalle and dated between c. 1415 and 1425. The painter's provisional name refers to the ""Abbey of Flémalle"" where certain of his works are assumed to have been painted. However, in this village near Liège there was never any abbey. Today the master is commonly identified with the Tournai artist Robert Campin.The scene takes place inside a bourgeois dwelling, a novelty in the painting of the time, as until then the scene had always been depicted in or in front of a church. In line with tradition, Gabriel enters the room from the left. The Virgin is seated in front of a low bench on the tiled floor, a sign of her humility. The edge of her mantle is decorated with an inscription, another innovation of the Master of Flémalle. Its text appears to be inspired by the popular medieval Marian hymn Salve Regina. The Virgin's gestures illustrate her acceptance. Her right hand rests on her breast, her eyes modestly cast downwards. On Mary's lap is an open book, a second one lies on the table. This motif is possibly taken from devotional tracts of around 1400, which state that the Virgin was meditating on the Holy Scriptures when Gabriel entered. The books also indicate her as the possessor of divine wisdom. In this connection, the bench is decorated with little lions, as was once the throne of Solomon, the Old Testament king who used to be seen as the epitome of wisdom. The stained glass figures possibly represent prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.Other apparently everyday objects also have an additional, deeper significance. The hand broom next to the chimney symbolises the purification from the stain of sin, and the white lilies in the maiolica vase Mary's virginity. The open window probably alludes to her honorary title as 'fenestra coeli', the window of heaven. The candles and their holders refer to Christ and the Virgin. The fact that the candles are snuffed out indicates that conception has already taken place. One intriguing detail is the woodcut above the chimney, depicting St Christopher carrying the Child across the river. This motif is a good illustration of the chronological jumps frequently found in the paintings of Flemish Primitives, as according to the main scene, depicting the Annunciation, the Saviour has not even been born"	MASTER of Flémalle	Annunciation	Tempera on oak, 61 x 63,7 cm	1420s	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

07338-st-john.jpg	This painting, contracted on 23 November 1635, was executed for the convent church of Santa Paula in Seville. It is evident that the artist had mastered an Italianate manner of painting; the figure of the angel alone is sufficient to corroborate this observation. The partly clad body, the complicated, foreshortened pose, and the mastery of anatomical drawing are unique elements in Sevillian painting of the time, as are the deep perspective of the landscape and the delicate, translucent colours.Cano's mastery of this facile, sophisticated style suggests that he had passed time in Italy, although there is not the slightest evidence that he left the city until his final departure in 1638	CANO, Alonso	Saint John the Evangelist's Vision of Jerusalem	Oil on canvas, 83 x 44 cm	1636-37	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

Compared to Gentile da Fabriano's painting of the same subject done in Florence just a few years before, Masaccio's treatment is entirely new. Besides offering lifelike portraits of the patron and his nephew in contemporary dress at the middle right, he has given the entire scene a convincing atmosphere which surrounds the figures and the landscape. In the distance, the atmosphere breaks down the clarity of the forms resulting in an effect which is referred to as aerial perspective	MASACCIO	Adoration of the Magi	Tempera on poplar, 21 x 61 cm	1426	religious	Italian	1401-1450

In this small village of Northern-Brabant, to where his parents moved in September 1882, more than four hundred people took up weaving, an activity of domestic industry during the winter months, when agricultural labour was suspended.The chronology of the series could be determined by the development in representing the loom. As time went by, van Gogh depicted the loom with more and more precision, abandoning the anecdotal elements and concentrating on the work process and on the machine itself	GOGH, Vincent van	Weaver, Seen from the Front	Oil on canvas, 70 x 85 cm	May 1884, Nuenen	other	Dutch	1851-1900

10416-19melanc.jpg	Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560) was a German reformer, collaborator with Martin Luther, the first systematic theologian of the Protestant Reformation, intellectual leader of the Lutheran Reformation, and an influential designer of educational systems. He stands next to Luther and Calvin as a reformer, theologian, and molder of Protestantism.Melanchthon had his portrait painted on numerous occasions, but he only sat to four artists: Albrecht Dürer (in an engraving of 1526); Hans Holbein the Younger (whose portrait of circa 1535 is in the Nieders&#228;chsisches Landesmuseums, Hannover); and both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son Lucas Cranach the Younger.Cranach the Younger painted several portraits of Melanchthon, probably from the mid 1540s onwards. The earliest would seem to be that dated 1544, in Östra Ryd, Sweden, and the last painted from life is that signed and dated 1559 in the St&#228;del Museum, Frankfurt am Main, finished just one year before Melanchthon's death at the age of 63. Such was the demand for portraits of Luther and Melanchthon that several posthumous works were produced by Cranach the Younger and his studio	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Portrait of Philipp Melanchthon	Oil on pine panel, 63 x 49 cm	c. 1550	portrait	German	1501-1550

18525-2summer1.jpg	Abel Grimmer continued the themes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and evoked the four seasons in many of his paintings. He copied the subjects produced by Bruegel while adding his own mark: a stylisation of the forms and the introduction of powerful colours.The present panel of Summer is an interpretation of the famous drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This drawing inspired numerous artists including his son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger. Not all refer to the drawing itself, but rather to the engraving of it made by Pieter Cock around 1570. Engraving flourished in Antwerp in the 16th century and was an excellent means of distribution. Hence, artists were familiar with the works of their contemporaries.There are other versions of this painting by Abel Grimmer	GRIMMER, Abel	Summer	Oil on panel, 24 x 37 cm	-	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
34296-sabine2.jpg	The Rape of the Sabine Women and its companion-piece the Battle of the Romans and the Sabines illustrates the legend of Rome's foundation.Romulus, the founder of Rome, succeeded by a ruse in ensuring the future growth of the population. He arranged a festival to which were invited the inhabitants of neighbouring settlements including the Sabines, with their wives and children. During the festivities, at a given signal, the young men of Rome broke into the crowd and, choosing only unmarried maidens of the Sabines, carried them off. The Sabine women accepted their lot. But later a Sabine army attacked the city in force and succeeded in overcoming part of it. They were prevented from going further by the intervention of the Sabine women which brought about peace between the warring soldiers.The glowing colours of the two paintings reveal the influence of Paolo Veronese, while the pastel illumination of Ricci's palette anticipates the Rococo	RICCI, Sebastiano	Battle of the Romans and the Sabines	Oil on canvas, 197 x 303 cm	c. 1700	historical	Italian	1701-1750
18753-guard219.jpg	"Francesco Guardi was a collaborator of Gianantonio, from whom he learned the craft of painting, but he introduced into his older brothers art his own profoundly meditative personality. This fact is evinced by the essential differences to be discerned in the works the ""workshop"" produced. This picture, unanimously attributed by researchers to Francesco, is, in all likelihood, the fragment of a larger composition. The whole scene is summarized in the slow and calm movement of the gondoliere in the foreground, whereas the scenery of the lagoon virtually disintegrates in the mother-of-pearl atmosphere, which is lightened here and there by some rare flashes in the background. The lonely gondola is seen in the lagoon at the Fondamente Nuove, in front of the islands of San Cristoforo and San Michele.The emotional intensity of the painting is condensed into this brief recording of the moment, as if it were a ""phrase in music"", for example in Vivaldi's or Albinoni's compositions of the same theme. The smooth lagoon and the ""adagio continuo"" are parallel motifs of picture and music. The scenery becomes dissolved in musicality, as musicality disintegrates ""in sorrowful weeping"" (Goethe).The mournful character of the black gondola is both a forecast and a conscious experience of the future destiny of the world of lagoons &#151; a world enclosed within its own modest boundaries. This is a world which has disappeared, because it was linked to a declining civilization. The argument was not continued, and it has not been taken up again; the other lagoon painters, such as the members of the Burano school, could not disguise the emptiness &#151; not only of form but also of content."

28665-1london3.jpg	"This canvas belongs to a series of eleven paintings executed after Monet's stays in London. The Parliament building is viewed from a window of St. Thomas's Hospital located on the opposite shore of the Thames.During his four visits to London between 1900 and 1905, Monet did a series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament. In these works his art attained new heights. Everything visible is resolved in the reflection of light. The subtitle of the painting, ""With the Sun Shining through Fog"", is significant. Not only the sky, but also the river and even the buildings are fused together in dazzling colour tones. The Houses of Parliament rise up out of the fog like a vision. It is not the building which seems to be present but rather its optical effect"	MONET, Claude	The Houses of Parliament in London	Oil on canvas, 81 x 92 cm	1904	landscape	French	1851-1900
25321-triptyc1.jpg	This painting is the central panel of a triptych. The wings represents Sts John the Baptist and Anthony of Padua with the donor Bonifazio Lupi (left), and Sts John the Evangelist and Louis of Toulouse with Catarina dei Francesi, the donor's wife.While continuing to refer to Giotto, Florentine painters began to introduce a refined linear Gothic style. An example is the triptych by Tommaso del Mazza, commisssioned for the main altar of the hospital founded in Florence by Bonifazio Lupi in 1386, and dedicated to Saint John the Baptist	MAZZA, Tommaso del	Virgin and Child with Eight Angels	Poplar panel, gold ground, 85 x 61 cm	c. 1385	religious	Italian	1351-1400
23919-denial.jpg	Manfredi created a series of theatrically lit compositions in which bawdy figures crowd around a table gambling, drinking and making music. In his Denial of St Peter the tavern scene is transformed into a religious narrative in which the soldiers' game of dice is given more prominence than Peter's betrayal. The religious event is thus cast within the context of secular life	MANFREDI, Bartolomeo	The Denial of St Peter	Oil on canvas, 166 x 232 cm	1615-16	religious	Italian	1601-1650

21214-richter2.jpg	The mood of the time is very evident in the matching pair of portrait's of Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal, who was a Viennese official who had been ennobled, and his wife, Maria Angelica Richter von Binnenthal, née Freiin von Zach. The graceful wife bears the 25-year difference in age from her husband with the same dignity as he wears his 1814 medal. Moreover, the colours of the clothing are skillfully balanced: her black dress with its white collar is the inversion of his Habsburg uniform. Her white lace collar also indicates a fashion during the Restoration, when the house of Habsburg liked to look back to its old Spanish empire	KRAFFT, Johann Peter	Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal	Oil on canvas, 53 x 43 cn	1814-15	portrait	Austrian	1801-1850

21435-fetewood.jpg	The composition reflects Lancret's dependence on Watteau, under whom he had briefly studied c. 1717.

20040-032mocki.jpg	This painting is closely related to another work by Honthors, a vertical version of the same theme in a private collection. Since some of the same expressive devices are found in both pictures - for example , the way in which the extended hand of the standing mocker holding a candle casts its shadow on his face - both were likely to have been executed relatively close in time.The size of the canvas suggests that it was a public commisssion, perhaps for a church in or near Rome	HONTHORST, Gerrit van	The Mocking of Christ	Oil on canvas, 146 x 207 cm cm	c. 1617	religious	Dutch	1601-1650
41521-z_battle.jpg	This large tapestry cartoon represents a subject drawn from Livy and Polybius. It was preparatory for the weaving of a section of the Tapestry of Scipio executed in Brussels c. 1558 for Jacques d'Albon, Maréchal de Saint-André and favourite of King Henri II  of France. The artist, who was certainly Mantuan and shows himself here to be a follower of Giulio Romano, was perhaps Fermo Ghisoni (c. 1505-1575)	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	The Battle of the Ticino	Distemper on sheets of paper mounted on canvas, 385 x 655 cm	1550s	historical	Italian	1551-1600
39675-13tribut.jpg	The subject of this painting is taken from the New Testament. The Pharisees ask Christ whether it is right to pay tax to the Romans. Christ, sensing the trap, asks whose likeness and name are on the coinage: 'They say unto him, Caesar's. Then he saith unto them, render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's' (Matthew 22; Mark 12, Luke 20).This painting was probably painted for King Philip II and sent to Spain in 1568	TIZIANO Vecellio	Tribute Money	Oil on canvas, 112 x 103 cm	1560-68	religious	Italian	1501-1550
43701-crawford.jpg	"This painting represents the full-length portrait of John 20th Earl of Crawford and Lindsay, ""The Gallant Earl of Crawford"" (1702-1749) dressed in Hussars' uniform holding a musket and standing in a highland landscape. Like his father he sought a military career; he entered the army in 1726 and was a captain in the 3rd foot guards by the end of 1734. Undoubted bravery, far-flung service, generosity of spirit, and courageous persistence in living with a painful wound made ""the gallant earl"" a hero to his contemporaries"	WAITT, Richard	Portrait of John 20th Earl of Crawford and Lindsay	Oil on canvas laid onto board	1725-30	portrait	Scottish	1701-1750

19406-stillif1.jpg	Heda did not start to paint diagonal compositions until the mid-1630s: the compositions start with flat plates, continue with pieces of ham and goblets, and culminate in a zenith-like fashion with beer or water jug. At times this pattern was of course broken, especially when Heda had to depict the valuable crockery of distinguished households, such as columbine goblets, cups of welcome, etc. Heda then went back either to his triangular or his pyramid-shaped compositions. But it is noticeable that whenever he did this, he also increased the incidence of 'chaotic' elements, showing, for example, the white table-cloth extremely crumpled as well as an overturned jug. (The overturning of goblets goes back to an ancient custom, and in the 16th and 17th centuries goldsmiths, for example, fashioned special goblets that had to be emptied all at once so that they could be placed on the table upside down.

16070-joachi1.jpg	The elderly Joachim is denied entry to the temple, as he has remained childless. The architecture reinforces the priest's gesture of rejection, to which the saint replies with a saddened look. The sheep, as a sacrificial animal that has become superfluous, has a particularly touching effect.The rejection of Joachim's sacrifice and his expulsion from the Temple occurred because of his childlessness. Here we are dealing with a true opening picture: the closed architecture of the temple introduces the first idea of solidity, while Joachim's dual movement brings this scene to a close, on the one hand, and on the other paves the way for the rest of the series, which finds a premature conclusion in the last picture of this register, the Meeting at the Golden Gate.The action is also driven forward by the repetition of buildings. Thus the temple of the opening picture reappears in the fresco Presentation of Christ at the Temple	GIOTTO di Bondone	No. 1 Scenes from the Life of Joachim: 1.

39719-2venus_a.jpg	"Between 1553 and 1554 Titian executed for the Habsburgs two classical mythological works of clearly erotic intent which he himself described as ""poesie"" (mythological fables). These are the Dana&#235; with a Nurse and the Venus and Adonis, both now in the Prado, Madrid. The Venus and Adonis became the prototype for a whole series of replicas of this subject.Venus, the goddess of love, falls in love with Adonis, a beautiful youth. Her love is not, however, enough to stop him pursuing his favourite pastime, hunting, which will lead to his undoing, for he is gored to death by a boar. There is an interesting letter from Titian to Philip II which deals with this painting. The artist makes a special point of mentioning that he was particularly interested in depicting the body from both sides.In both paintings the scene of the union of the lovers is bathed in the warm light of sunset, where the diffuse softness of the colours holds sway. The female nudes reveal the continuing inspiration of Michelangelo's sculpture, such as the Dawn and Night from the Medici tombs in Florence. But what is entirely personal to Titian is the quality of the colour, which fragments into patches of dazzling luminosity - a perfect complement to the ecstatic sensuous abandon of the figures.In its own day Venus and Adonis was considered one of Titian's most erotic works, especially in the compression of Venus' buttocks in her seated pose, but it also suggests the indulgent condescension of a younger man towards the frantic and overprotective reaction of an older woman"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 180 x 207 cm	1554	mythological	Italian	1501-1550
08156-reale.jpg	In the 1650s Castello developed a scheme of a simulated opening on the ceiling with symmetrical architectural framing elements incorporating additional figures and motifs. On the ceiling in the Palazzo Reale (formerly Palazzo Balbi Durazzo), showing the Triumph of the Balbi, he worked together with his pupil, Giovanni Maria Mariani	CASTELLO, Valerio	Triumph of the Balbi	Fresco	c. 1655	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
26746-06_1sp5f.jpg	The figures are in the triangular spandrel in the sixth bay between Ezekiel and the Persian Sibyl. The spandrel is situated over the Rehoboam-Abijah lunette.Michelangelo painted a family group in this lunette. The woman, seen in profile, is seated in the foreground, in an absorbed attitude, her chin resting on her hand; with her other arm she embraces her child. Behind her, the gray-haired head of a male figure emerges from the shadows.Above, on each side of the ram's skull, the bronze nudes no longer take the form of motionless, reclining figures, but are howling demons who struggle furiously in almost acrobatic positions in the restricted space enclosing them. Although their poses are perfectly symmetrical, their hair seems to be blown in the same direction, as if by a sudden gust of wind.It is usually assumed that the male figure in the shadows represents Solomon, the father of Rehoboam	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Ancestors of Christ: figures	Fresco, 245 x 340 cm	1511	religious	Italian	1501-1550
24599-st_john3.jpg	The left wing shows Salome offering the head of St John the Baptist to Herod. In this panel every face bears the stamp of evil. Herodias uses the tip of her knife to make her mark in the saint's forehead; she is presented as the perfect courtesan untrustworthy and vindictive. Herod himself, with his thick lips, hooked nose and narrowed eyes, even seems a little frightened by what he has just done. The whole panel is marked by an extraordinary sense of profane pleasure in such a sumptuous display of rich colours	MASSYS, Quentin	St John Altarpiece (left wing)	Oil on wood	1507-08	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
18912-11aurora.jpg	The ceiling painting in the Sala della Fama, the central hall on the second floor, is entirely allegorical. The central picture is designed as a fictive opening with only a few figures. In the centre hovers the personification of Fame in billowing robes, holding in her outstretched hands an extremely long trumpet and an olive branch as a symbol of peace. Flying in front of her is the brightly feathered phoenix of myth, which is reborn out of its own ashes every five hundred years and was therefore considered a symbol of eternal renewal, but was understood also as a link to virtue. In the lower part of the picture space personifications of Honour (Honos) and Virtue (Virtus) are seated on a dark gray cloud.

00819-marco_p9.jpg	This picture was placed on the right lateral side of the predella. Justinian sleeps while Sts Cosmas and Damian enter his chamber trailing patches of soft cloud. They replace his corrupted leg with a healthy one. The room is Spartan but the variety of light-sources and Angelico's close observation give it interest. Light floods in from outside through the window on the left, illuminating its own frame and parts of the swags of curtain. Exterior space is indicated not only by the window but by the door opposite it, from whence comes more light. From the front left outside the picture comes the third source of light, which produces a broad diagonal sweep across the right wall. The curtain provides the rectangular backdrop parallel to the picture surface which is common to each of these predella panels, and also hints at more, obscured space behind it. The container hanging from a nail on the side of the bed, the glass and decanter, the slippers and the simple three-legged stool, all provide the constituents of a closely observed still-life	ANGELICO, Fra	The Healing of Justinian by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian	Tempera on wood, 37 x 45 cm	1438-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450
34462-18rippl.jpg	The picture represents a major milestone in Rippl's oevre where two periods meet: elements of  intimate interior pictures  and those of the next decorative period with  corn are present. There is a constant figure of interior pictures: a old man smoking the pipe while he is meditating. He is present in this picture, too, he is sitting by the artist's father lost in thoughts. Unlike his previous pictures showing interiors, he limits space and does not show details, only relevant things. It integrates less formal pictures arresting emotions and atmospheres with pictures of strict composition.In the case of this picture everything is planned, colours and figures serve the unity of the composition. Spots and patches painted with wide brushstrokes can be seen in the figure of Uncle Piacsek and the lively yellow of the plain background. Neither the new technique, nor  the noisy colours  (yellow wall, burning-red table-cloth)  serve unrestrained decorativity, they balance the strict composition.  This is why an armchair  with blue striped cover  and a green cover are placed  on both sides by the yellow background. The wine-jug and the two glasses have the same function in composition	RIPPL-RÓNAI, József	Father and Uncle Piacsek Drinking Red Wine	Oil on cardboard, 68 x 100 cm	1907	portrait	Hungarian	1851-1900
30682-basket.jpg	This painting of a basket of flowers and its pair (Madrid, Museo del Prado) follow closely a type of flower piece made popular by Juan de Arellano in which the flowers occupy an open weave wicker basket placed on a rough stone ledge. Such images of flowers casually arranged and filling an open weave basket differ from the formal presentations of bouquets in vases and were perhaps intended to be seen as recently-gathered fresh flowers on short stems. Although the paintings have been considered early works by Pérez for reasons of their closeness to the typology of Arellano s works, they show that the painter was evidently in full possession of the technical resources that distinguish his mature style.In the 17th century, flower paintings commonly made up the decoration of chapels and monastic institutions. While it does not appear that symbolism played a significant role in Spanish flower paintings, viewers of a more sombre cast of mind could have read a Vanitas message in such pictures, in which the brief life of the flowers was a metaphor for human existence.

41468-madfinch.jpg	According to legend, the goldfinch acquired the red spot on its brow when it removed a thorn from Christ's head during his ascent to Calvary, and was splashed with a drop of blood. Its inclusion in images of the Madonna and Child is, therefore, a symbol of Christ's future Passion.This well-preserved panel was formerly attributed to Antonio Vivarini, then to Girolamo di Giovanni da Camerino.

He was a frequent visitor to the Café Guerbois group, which included Manet, at the centre of the group, and many writers and painters. Their vigorous debates provided Degas with an entirely new mental environment.Degas was particularly close to Duranty, and painted a celebrated portrait of him in 1879.

On the right of the picture, the royal household and dignitaries of empire are gathered, while the father of the bride, Count Raynald of Burgundy, kneels on the steps to the left of the altar, accompanied by two pageboys. The court jester, seen from behind, occupies a prominent position in the foreground at the foot of the steps to the altar, an example of Tiepolo's penchant for introducing witty and frivolous ideas to the agreed pictorial subject matter. The steps to the altar lead us into the picture and, along with the colossal background architecture, create great spatial depth. The musicians on the balcony in the background are a favourite motif of Tiepolo, which he uses to help make the historical subject matter topical	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Marriage of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Beatrice of Burgundy	Fresco, 400 x 500 cm	1751	historical	Italian	1701-1750

00475-venus2.jpg	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn. These subjects represent two of the most recognizable and classic of all mythological stories, both with a rich history of pictorial representation in Venetian art. They are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and in the case of Venus and Adonis, Amigoni returned to the subject throughout his career	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Bacchus and Ariadne	Oil on canvas, 104 x 129 cm	1730s	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

05715-03beach.jpg	"The skill at seizing the ephemeral and noting essentials characterize the views of Trouville painted by Boudin. Trouville was a fashionable resort under the Second Empire.Boudin, the son of a Honfleur sailor, spent most of his life in seaside towns and concentrated on painting landscapes by the sea, everyday coastal scenes. The tradition he was following was primarily an English one, though Boudin did not paint ships at sea. The pictures he painted over the years in his loose, sketchy way did not, strictly speaking, possess any central subjects. Even his market or beach scenes present an extensive panorama of colour and economically deployed line accentuation. The atmosphere is bright, moist and highly sensitively registered. Corot in old age dubbed Boudin ""the king of the skies."	BOUDIN, Eug?ne	Beach Scene, Trouville	Oil on panel, 26 x 48 cm	1864	landscape	French	1851-1900
35064-carwardi.jpg	This portrait is said to have been the first picture that Romney completed after his return from Italy. In Italy Romney was seduced by Italy's classical heritage, in particular the work of Raphael.The sitter of this portrait, Mrs. Anne Carwardine (1752-1817) was the wife of Thomas Carwardine, a close friend of Romney. She is shown half-length, seated, wearing a black dress and a white lace shawl with a white bonnet, holding her eldest son Thomas (1772-1822) in her arms. The portrait acknowledges a debt to Raphael's Madonna della Sedia	ROMNEY, George	Portrait of Mrs Anne Carwardine and Her Eldest Son, Thomas	Oil on canvas, 75 x 62 cm	1775	portrait	English	1751-1800

27095-exphagar.jpg	The biblical story depicted in the paintings is the following.Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ismael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting	MIERIS, Willem van	Expulsion of Hagar	Oil on canvas mounted on panel, 44 x 34 cm	1724	religious	Dutch	1701-1750
34475-1virgin.jpg	At the end of the 1640s Rizi worked at the court in Madrid, although without an official appointment. Part of his time was dedicated to painting for the Buen Retiro theater, where his undeniable talent for scenographic painting developed. This is displayed in his Virgin and Child with Sts Philip and Francis which might be called the first High Baroque altarpiece painting in Spain. The composition is enclosed within an illusionistic proscenium arch, behind which is seen a landscape vista drawn in the deep perspective of contemporary stage sets. The Virgin and Child are surrounded by a small army of fluttering putti, whose varied poses imitate the heavenly glories of Rubens. While the main figures are still firmly and solidly drawn, they have taken on a new sense of animation and movement	RIZI, Francisco	Virgin and Child with Sts Philip and Francis	Oil on canvas	1650	religious	Spanish	1651-1700
34933-13berze.jpg	There are wonderful wall paintings in the Cluniac chapel of Ch&#226;teau des Moines at Berzé-la-Ville, near Cluny.

20185-commemor.jpg	Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory. In Renaissance painting she is depicted holding a cup or goblet.This painting appears to be influenced by the paintings of the Leidein fijnschilders	HOUBRAKEN, Arnold	Commemoration of King Mausolus by Queen Artemisia	Oil on canvas, 66 x 79 cm	-	historical	Dutch	1651-1700

05557-14dante.jpg	The striking profile of the poet, which has been drawn over in black, clearly contrasts with the light background. In accordance with traditional depictions, Dante is wearing a red cloak and red cap above a white bonnet. Botticelli was surely familiar with Domenico de Michelino's fresco of Dante in Florence Cathedral, as this was the first to show the poet with a laurel wreath on his head.

12490-05self26.jpg	This self portrait is dated 1498 and inscribed: `I have thus painted myself. I was 26 years old. Albrecht Dürer.' Since the artist turned 27 on the 21 May, the picture must date from the beginning of the year. The artist's pose is self confident, showing him standing upright and turning slightly to lean his right arm on a ledge. Dürer's figure fills the picture, with his hat almost touching the top. His face and neck glow from the light streaming into the room and his long curly hair is painstakingly depicted. Unlike his earlier self portrait, he now has a proper beard, which was then unusual among young men. Nine years later Dürer wrote an ironic poem in which he described himself as `the painter with the hairy beard'.The artist's clothing is flamboyant. His elegant jacket is edged with black and beneath this he wears a white, pleated shirt, embroidered along the neckline. His jaunty hat is striped, to match the jacket. Over his left shoulder hangs a light-brown cloak, tied around his neck with a twisted cord. He wears fine kid gloves.Inside the room is a tall archway, partly framing Dürer's head, and to the right a window opens out onto an exquisite landscape. Green fields give way to a tree-ringed lake and beyond are snow-capped mountains, probably a reminder of Dürer's journey over the Alps three years earlier. Depicting a distant landscape, viewed through a window, was a device borrowed from Netherlandish portraiture.The Germans still tended to consider the artist as a craftsman, as had been the conventional view during the Middle Ages. This was bitterly unacceptable to Dürer, whose second Self-Portrait (out of three) shows him as slender and aristocratic, a haughty and foppish youth, ringletted and impassive. His stylish and expensive costume indicates, like the dramatic mountain view through the window (implying wider horizons), that he considers himself no mere limited provincial. What Dürer insists on above all else is his dignity, and this was a quality that he allowed to others too.This picture was acquired by Charles I of England and later bought by Philip IV of Spain	DÜRER, Albrecht	Self-Portrait at 26	Oil on panel, 52 x 41 cm	1498	portrait	German	1501-1550
41507-caldogn1.jpg	An unidentified artist, who was close to Giovanni Battista Zelotti, partially frescoed a room (later called the Pastor Fido camerino) with episodes from Torquato Tasso's Aminta.

02996-nativity.jpg	Baldovinetti's Annunciation is in the atrium of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. His interest in local landscape is evident in the Arno Valley view that he chose as the background of this fresco. In fact he painted only a few portions of the picture in true fresco, and then waited until the plaster had dried so that he could paint 'a secco.' But because the fresco was located in an atrium exposed to winter fogs and even rain, in time the a secco faces, hands, and drapery peeled off, and his underdrawing is now visible. Even so, the painting is impressive in the airy openness of its setting and the view over the expansive Tuscan plain, which is filled with the light of a clear winter day	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Nativity	Fresco, 400 x 430 cm	1460-62	religious	Italian	1451-1500
31304-childhoo.jpg	This scene, which probably formed part of a group of panels devoted to the life of Christ, brings together in one spatial setting various episodes from Christ's childhood, giving the painting great narrative interest. Along with the Nativity (treated in the traditional manner of the period, with the Virgin lying down and Joseph on a lower level), the artist has also included the shepherds in the background, two women washing the new-born Christ, and the Adoration of the Magi.

19022-woodedla.jpg	Hackaert specialised particularly in Italianate landscapes and woodland scenes, the present canvas depicting a wooded landscape with a shepherd and his herd is an example of the latter category. Influenced greatly by the respective styles of Dutch Italianate artists such as Jan Both and Jan Asselijn, Hackaert's treatment of colour owes much to these two predecessors.

42013-attribut.jpg	The old rivalry between painting and sculpture, the sister arts devoted to the imitation of nature, resurfaces in this painting. The painters had shown that, in their two-dimensional pictures, they were quite capable of offering several views of a body that was equally beautiful from all sides. What theoreticians had presented as an advantage of sculpture became a particular challenge to painting. A plaster Academy model of the antique Belvedere Torso (1st century AD, Rome, Vatican) is here rendered in paint. Like painting and sculpture, architecture was also considered an art of draughtsmanship. Inspired by Chardin, this academic still-life is devoid of all reference to the theme of vanitas that was generally present in compositions on a comparable theme by the older Dutch masters: the focus now falls upon the enlightened erudition of art	VALLAYER-COSTER, Anne	Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture	Oil on canvas, 90 x 121 cm	1769	still-life	French	1751-1800
38597-guardrox.jpg	In a large, open, barn-like structure, which serves as a guardroom, groups of monkeys wearing soldiers' uniforms are grouped around tables playing cards and back-gammon.Pictures of monkeys had been popular from the sixteenth-century and it was Teniers who developed the theme in the seventeenth-century. The primary role of the monkey in visual and literary sources of the sixteenth-century was to represent the irrational and foolish side of man's nature, but monkeys also were symbols of sinfulness and seen as devils	TENIERS, David the Younger	Guardroom with Monkeys	Oil on panel, 41 x 58 cm	1633	genre	Flemish	1651-1700

37294-40madonn.jpg	"A great deal has been written about the iconography of the Madonna from Lucignano d'Arbia, very unusual in Sienese painting. Mary is shown looking to the right, instead of to the left, and she holds a Child who is not yet a ""puer"" (as was the case in all the earlier paintings) but still an ""infans"" in swaddling clothes. The reason that led Simone to choose this iconography has yet to be explained, and it may have been a specific request from the client; but scholars do agree on the attribution of the panel to Simone"	SIMONE MARTINI	Madonna and Child (from Lucignano d'Arbia)	Tempera on wood, 88 x 51 cm	1321	religious	Italian	1301-1350

28672-3bridge1.jpg	In 1893, Monet purchased land with a pond near his property in Giverny, and he built here his water lily garden with a Japanese bridge spanning the pond at its narrowest point. In 1899, he began a series of eighteen views of the wooden footbridge over the pond, completing twelve paintings, including the present one, that summer. The vertical format of the picture, unusual in this series, gives prominence to the water lilies and their reflections on the pond	MONET, Claude	Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies	Oil on canvas, 93 x 74 cm	1899	landscape	French	1851-1900

18403-1903grec.jpg	El Greco painted several views of Toledo. Seen beneath mountainous clouds the city stirred his imagination and in this painting, as in others, the representation includes an element of fantasy and is not strictly accurate. In the El Greco Museum there is a painting in which a young man is seen holding up a map of the city. The map partially corrects the view of the city in which, to improve the composition as the inscription tells us, El Greco gave the Hospital of Don Juan Tavera a central place in the picture; transferring it from its actual setting so that the façade could be shown without blocking out the other important buildings. In the upper part of the picture there is a scene in which the Virgin presents a vestment to St Ildefonso. The landscape is painted in brownish-green and blue tints, and the mythological and religious elements are minimal; with his pictures of Toledo El Greco created the Spanish landscape, a branch of art which was nevertheless neglected until the emergence of Velázquez.It is sometimes supposed that the young man is a portrait of El Greco's son, who was, however, at least thirty years old at that time	GRECO, El	View and Plan of Toledo	Oil on canvas, 132 x 228 cm	c. 1610	landscape	Spanish	1551-1600
09642-grotesq1.jpg	This painting (and another in the same private collection) are illuminating examples of the type of decorative flower pieces in series in which De la Corte specialised. The complete series is likely to have comprised a number of other pictures of the same type. These pictures are trompe l'oeil works that depict fictive carved stone or stucco-work grotesques of scrolling vegetable ornament with intertwining flower garlands. It is unlikely that these grotesques existed as such and they were most probably copied from 16th or 17th-century ornamental prints.While the grotesques are repeated in each picture, the floral arrangements vary and offer a delightful interplay between the natural-looking flowers and the stylised vegetable ornaments. The repetition of the grotesque decorations and the downward-looking angle of the cherubs gaze in the paintings suggest that these pictures were intended to make up a frieze on the upper part of the wall in a private residence of the time.

03935-stbernar.jpg	Jacopo Bellini had more than one opportunity to observe St Bernardino (1380-1444) and hear him preach. His portrait gives us a close-up view of the saint who stands before a velvet cloth decorated with thistle leaves and Christ's monogram. The saint's mouth is open, displaying three small teeth, and his eyes are directed downward toward a crucifix. The saint is shown as a living, speaking presence, perhaps the first such portrait of the Renaissance.The Sienese preacher St Bernardino, a prominent figure in the reform branch of the Franciscan order known as the Observants, was widely portrayed. In addition to a death mask, there are medals, standing and bust-length painted depictions, terracotta busts and statues, and engravings. Following his canonization in 1450, he was shown repeatedly in altarpieces	BELLINI, Jacopo	St Bernardino da Siena	Tempera on wood, 30 x 21 cm	1450-55	religious	Italian	1401-1450
07486-16martha.jpg	The painting has an iconographically very unusual theme. It shows Martha reproaching Mary Magdalene for her vanity, a subject that we know through a series of copies. The painting at Detroit has recently been recognized as the original.The religious theme is treated in a substantially profane manner. It is a pretext for making passages of highly intensive painting and for constructing an image that, seen in the context of the usual dichotomy of Caravaggio's early years, is more of a genre scene than a religious one	CARAVAGGIO	Martha and Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 98 x 133 cm	c. 1598	religious	Italian	1551-1600
42149-conquest.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.The iconographic theme of the hall of the Sala dello Scrutinio was inspired by the Venetian naval victories on the Eastern seas shown in the numerous ceiling canvases depicting virtues and symbolic figures. Vassilacchi's Conquest of Tyre on the wall of the Sala del Scrutinio depicts a historical event which occurred in 1123 under the rule of Doge Domenico Michiel, who commanded the Venetian fleet in the East	VASSILACCHI, Antonio	Conquest of Tyre	Oil on canvas	c. 1590	historical	Italian	1551-1600
41878-vendra01.jpg	This villa is typical of the Veneto Region with gardens and decorative murals. It was owned by the Grimani family for more than 200 years and bequeathed to the comune by its last private owner, Elena Vendramin Calergi (married Andrea Valmarana in 1826). It is now the seat of The Valmarana foundation named for her.The villa underwent extensive renovations in 1757 on the occasion of the marriage of Francesco Vendramin Grimani Calergi and Bianca Morosini. This was the time when Andrea Urbani was engaged to fresco the portego (the large ground-floor room that traverses the building from front to back) and the seven rooms on the second floor.The decoration of the portego is limited to the walls, on which there are three large landscapes set within ornate, faux architectural settings, also designed by Urbani. The west wall contains View of a Villa with a Pool and Landscape with Waterfall, while the opposite wall has View of a Large Renaissance Palace, divided into two parts by the staircase door. In the centre foreground of each landscape, on a trompe-l'oeil pedestal, is a faux-bronze statuary group representing the struggle between Good and Evil	URBANI, Andrea	View of the portego	Fresco	1764-68	interior	Italian	1751-1800
06288-backoper.jpg	The figures in Brouwer's later pictures, produced after he had settled in Antwerp, are especially animated in gesture and expression, manifesting an unprecedented display of skill matched only by the sophisticated style in which they were painted. The Back Operation is an outstanding representative of Brouwer's late style. The artist has intensified the monochromatic effects of his earlier works, rendering them in a higher key than previously, and he has reduced his composition to just three figures who proportionally occupy a significant area of the interior space	BROUWER, Adriaen	The Back Operation	Oil on panel, 34 x 27 cm	1635-36	genre	Flemish	1601-1650

15337-jupiter.jpg	The composition of this painting is clearly related to a work by Luca Giordano depicting the Sleeping Venus with Cupid and a Satyr in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples.

06087-taylor_s.jpg	Quiringh van Brekelenkam worked in Leiden, where he was influenced by Dou's domestic subjects and by Metsu's broad touch and intense colours. He is best known for his paintings of men and women artisans working at various crafts: cobblers, lace makers, spinners, fish mongers, and so forth. Outstanding is his Tailor's Shop of 1653 at the Worcester Art Museum where he finds quiet poetry in a view of a humble interior with the master and his two apprentices at work, seated tailor-fashion on the table while an old woman prepares a meal. Thirteen variations of the Worcester painting have been recorded (fine ones are at Amsterdam, London, Philadelphia, and Bonn); an indication that there must have been a good market for the motif. Like so many genre painters of his time, he turned to more elegant subjects in the sixties	BREKELENKAM, Quiringh van	Interior of a Tailor's Shop	Oil on canvas, 55 x 75 cm	1653	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

On its rear wall Mitelli painted a grand double staircase that visually enlarges the actual size of the room through a deceptive perspectival device. The figure of a court official, painted by Mitelli's partner Angelo Michele Colonna (c. 1600-1687) is seen in the act of climbing the imaginary stairs, thus adding a sense of illusionary reality.In the Palazzo Pitti commission the Colonna-Mitelli collaboration developed a successful model that the pair was able to translate to other situations. The best example of this is the painting, from a few years later, in the salone of the d'Este summer residence in Sassuolo, near Modena	MITELLI, Agostino	View of the Sala dell'Udienza del Granduca	Fresco	1636-41	interior	Italian	1601-1650

05055-landscap.jpg	During his lifetime Bonzi was particularly renowned for his still-lifes, but, like Filippo Napoletano, he was also active as a painter of landscapes. His output in this genre became entangled with that of Agostino Tassi, even though the two do not really have much in common. In addition to this canvas, Bonzi's certain works include The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and The Rest of Hercules (both in the Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome), Nymph and Faun (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini, Rome) and Latona and the Frogs (Musée du Louvre, Paris).Bonzi was clearly influenced by Annibale Carracci and to an even greater extent by Domenichino, but his compositions are more open on both sides and his terrain much flatter. His foregrounds spread out freely without obstacles such as large rocks or bushes, almost inviting the viewer to walk into the picture. His rather awkward figures tend to move parallel to the picture plane in a frieze-like procession. In the early 1620s he worked at the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal hill with Filippo Napoletano, each decorating different rooms. In this landscape Bonzi's close attention to naturalistic detail suggests the influence of Bril. Establishing a chronology for Bonzi's landscapes is almost impossible, but this work is perhaps not too far in date from the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi frescoes. The shepherds' nakedness indicates that the scene is not contemporary (even though sheep-farming had largely replaced cultivation in the Roman campagna around this time), but rather an episode from Virgil's Arcadia	BONZI, Pietro Paolo	Landscape with Shepherds and Sheep	Oil on canvas, 47 x 64 cm	c. 1621	landscape	Italian	1601-1650

39994-3redhea4.jpg	There are very different types of woman in Lautrec's female gallery, with whom he had more or less lasting relationships. They tend to remain anonymous, known only by their first name, or by their portraits, which are rich in psychological, humorous human perceptions. Most of them are red-heads, for Lautrec had a passion for red hair.

34916-1auxerr1.jpg	In St. Stephen's Chapel in the crypt of Saint-Germain in Auxerre, the visitor is confronted by a surprising composition: the stoning of St. Stephen is depicted in a tympanum. It illustrates, inspired by the text from the Acts of the Apostles (6:12), the final phase of the appearance of St. Stephen before his judges. In the middle of the trial he has a vision and declares that God has appeared to him. Then accused of blasphemy, he is stoned to death.Nearly all of the left-hand half of the picture is taken up by the representation  of a town which is scaled down in size in proportion to the figures. St. Stephen has just been dragged through this city gate and onto the place of his execution. Towering behind the humble St. Stephen, his torturers are depicted with their arms raised up ready to throw the stones. The figure of St. Stephen himself projects into the right half of the picture which otherwise consists of an empty space, broken up to great effect by the appearance of the hand of God	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French	Stoning of St Stephen	Fresco	c. 800	religious	French	0751-0800

00468-sisera.jpg	This painting relates the story of Jael and Sisera in tones of delicate colours that contrast emphatically with the drama of the biblical event recounted. It was painted after the artist's return too Venice from travels that took him to most of Europe, when his palette became brighter and more refined.Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Jael and Sisera	Oil on canvas	c. 1739	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
19439-stil_lif.jpg	"De Heem's still-life paintings initially followed the style of the Haarlem school, but later drew closer to the more lavish Flemish style of large-scale still-lifes. Nevertheless, certain Dutch elements cannot be overlooked. In this painting, they are particularly evident at the points where a ""dialectical principle"" determines the compositional structure.A mass of fruit and flowers ranging from ripe chestnuts to blackberries, from columbine to roses, has been arranged on a stone slab. A wide variety of surfaces, each with a different effect in light, with pure or iridescent colours, is spread out before us. Yet snails are already crawling across the vine leaves, the foliage is discoloured and withering and, the ears of grain are curling, the peach has burst its skin, the citrus fruit is half peeled, the white carnation is dried and drooping over the table edge.At the very point where the image bears an iconographic message of the transience of worldly life in the form of nature's riches, we see these things in their last bloom of beauty. Just as a ruin could represent the picturesque appeal of architecture, so too can a vine leaf riddled with snails seem picturesque in the full and final flowering of its beauty"	HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de	Still-Life	Oil on panel, 56 x 74 cm	-	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650

32214-19midas.jpg	In Greek legend Midas was a king of Phrygia who was granted a wish by Bacchus in return for a good deed he had done to Silenus, a follower of the god. Midas wished that everything he touched be turned to gold, but soon realized his mistake when all food became inedible. Bacchus ordered him to wash in the River Pactolus in Lydia. Hence the popular aetiology of the gold-bearing properties of the river, thought to have been the source of wealth of the kings of Lydia, of whom Croesus was the last.Midas is depicted penitently before Bacchus, a drunken Silenus sleeping nearby.

30863-keys.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Likely in charge of the entire project of the fresco decoration on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, Pietro Perugino retained for himself not only representations on the altar wall (which eventually were replaced by Michelangelo's Last Judgment) but also other significant scenes, such as Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, a most fitting subject for Pope Sixtus' chapel. The fresco is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the gold and silver keys to the kneeling St Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open piazza is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles, although they are not used in defining the spatial organization. Nor is the relationship between the figures and the felicitous invention of the porticoed Temple of Salomon that dominates the picture effectively resolved. The triumphal arches at the extremities appear as superfluous antiquarian references, suitable for a Roman audience. Scattered in the middle distance are two secondary scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right.The style of the figures is dependent upon Verrocchio. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to  minor detail.The octagonal temple with its ample porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael	PERUGINO, Pietro	Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter	Fresco, 335 x 550 cm	1481-82	religious	Italian	1451-1500
10630-riverban.jpg	Cuyp's earliest dated landscapes of 1639 are astonishingly eclectic, but by 1641 he was painting panoramic views of the Dutch countryside in the monochromatic mode of van Goyen. The young Cuyp, however, favoured a distinct yellow tonality as against van Goyen greyish and brown hues. More important for Cuyp's subsequent development was the impact of Dutch landscapists who brought an Italianate style from Rome back to Holland; Cuyp himself never travelled to the south.Since very few of Cuyp's landscapes are dated, and none is dated after 1645, it is difficult to say precisely when the characteristic golden light, reminiscent of the Campagna the artist never saw, replaces the earlier paler one, and when mountain ranges, herds of cattle, and figures conspicuously set off against a sky begin to play an important role in his compositions. But by 1645 distinct traces of the style of Cornelis Poelenburgh, a member of the first generation of Italianate painters, and Jan Both, the leading artist of the following generation of Italianate landscapists, are evident. Jan Both became Cuyp's principal source of inspiration. The River-bank with Cows shows how rapidly he assimilated Both's motifs and sun-drenched light. From this time onward golden sunlight becomes the all-pervading element in Cuyp's paintings. It spreads warmth and beauty over the Dutch countryside, where sturdy animals - most often cows - take place of human heroes	CUYP, Aelbert	River-bank with Cows	Oil on canvas	c. 1650	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
37371-moret1.jpg	Sisley went tirelessly in search of motifs along the Seine and its tributaries, he looked no further. He abided by views of village streets, or of interesting groups of buildings, he would be drawn to an old stone bridge, the kind of subject that had fascinated painters since Corot. In unprepossessing patches of gardens or meadows, landscapes on the skirts of towns or along river banks, he could often discover the most arresting colour or light effects	SISLEY, Alfred	Moret-sur-Loing in Morning Sun	Oil on canvas, 61 x 74 cm	1888	landscape	French	1851-1900

32451-sebastia.jpg	This canvas is the creative legacy of Mattia Preti's stay in Naples. The picture clearly takes off Caravaggio's light as its point of departure. The refined way in which it is painted, however, as well as the use of elegant details and the classically-inspired pose of the saint's statuesque body bathed in a ray of light are all extremely revealing about the painter's extensive and important travels.

18886-abraham.jpg	Guercino is one of the most interesting personalities in seventeenth-century Bolognese art, and his activity in Rome made him an important influence on all Italian painting. More than from Venice and Correggio, his work derives from Dosso Dossi and the school of Ferrara. This painting represents one of the high points of Guercino's mature style. Its restoration by the Brera's laboratory has revealed the original colours and eliminated the yellowish patina that obfuscated and partially hid the composition.The painting is built up on a measured circular rhythm, and the prominent gestures of the figures are emphasized almost to the point of theatricality. Little Ishmael is crying and leaning his head against Hagar. As she consoles him and holds out a handkerchief, she turns toward Abraham, who stands stern and still, making a gesture of repudiation. Sarah, seen from behind, appears to be moving away from the scene. The low-keyed colour helps avoid any rhetorical suggestion, while the slow rhythm of the composition creates a sense of inevitability.The city of Cento commissioned this painting, which was then presented to the Cardinal Legate of Ferrara, Lorenzo Imperiali	GUERCINO	Abraham Casting Out Hagar and Ishmael	Oil on canvas, 115 x 154 cm	1657	religious	Italian	1601-1650

21387-lycomed2.jpg	This subject is rare in seventeenth-century Northern Netherlandish art. However, it became extremely popular in Flanders after Rubens' version appeared in c. 1616. There are three known versions of the theme by Lairesse: in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig.The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Knowing her son was destined to die if he went to fight in the Trojan war, Thethis, a sea nymph, disguised Achilles as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes, in whose palace on the isle of Scyros he lived among the king's daughters. Odysseus and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch Achilles. They cunningly laid a heap of gifts before the girls - jewellery, clothes and other finery, but among them a sword, spear and shield. When a trumpet was sounded, Achilles instinctively snatched up the weapons and thus betrayed his identity.Lairesse, like all other artists who rendered the subject, chose the scene Achilles examining the weapons	LAIRESSE, Gérard de	Achilles Discovered among the Daughters of Lycomedes	Oil on canvas, 150 x 181 cm	c. 1685	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

36801-crisosto.jpg	This altarpiece depicts St John Chrysostom with Sts Catherine, Magdalen, Lucy, John the Evangelist, John the Baptist and Theodore. It is a painting with an official, doctrinal message, based on the association of the three Johns. Chrysostom is sitting side on, not in compliance with any mannerist idiosyncrasy but simply to enable us to see and read the book of his golden Word.The altarpiece has at the centre an old man reading, oblivious of the saints around him. It is a tightly knit and crowded group, the slightly yearning figure of St John the Baptist on the right looking inwards is balanced by a trio of grandly assured, superb Venetian beauties looking forwards and outwards at the spectator. The figures are in an architectural setting.This altarpiece is the major work of Sebastiano executed in Venice before he removed to Rome permanently in 1511	SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO	San Giovanni Crisostomo Altarpiece	Oil on canvas, 200 x 156 cm	1510-11	religious	Italian	1501-1550
22597-6madsain.jpg	The work probably dates from the artist's early career. It may be the first indoor sacra conversazione in the history of Italian painting.In Florence in the first half of the fifteenth century the market for devotional images was dominated by sculpture, not painting. Consequently, sculptural reliefs exerted a profound influence on painted compositions of the Madonna and Child. This early painting by Filippo Lippi takes its inspiration from a marble relief from the workshop of Donatello (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) that also exists in molded versions	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	Madonna and Child with Saints, Angels, and a Donor	Panel, 47 x 36 cm	c. 1437	religious	Italian	1401-1450
28703-stilife.jpg	Monnoyer was, in his prime in the 1670s, the foremost still-life painter in Europe, but his skill has been much underestimated in recent years, due to the proliferation of incorrect attributions to him. He specialized in flower pieces of the most elaborate design, although in the early part of his career he produced more conventional still-life paintings, such as the one in the Musée Fabre at Montpellier.The painting was executed in 1665 and submitted to the Academy at the time of the painter's admission in the same year. Following the upheavals of the Revolution in 1789, it was deposited at Montpellier in 1804.

42052-betrotha.jpg	Between 1360 and 1370 Lippo Vanni executed a cycle of fresco paintings for the church of the rural hermitage of San Leonardo al Lago just outside Siena. Painted on the walls and entrance arch of the chancel of this church, the scheme includes narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin, such as the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, the Annunciation, the Betrothal of the Virgin, and the Assumption of the Virgin (over the chancel arch, now badly damaged)	VANNI, Lippo	The Betrothal of the Virgin	Fresco	1360s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
03825-112madon.jpg	The painting, which has been in Bergamo since the 16th century, probably formed part of the dowry of the Carmelite nun Lucrezia Agliardi Vertova, abbess of the Sant'Anna monastery at Albino.On the parapet in front of the Virgin, a detail present in many other similar compositions, there is a fruit. Like the walled and many-towered city on the right, and the inlet on the left, it is a symbol referring to the Virgin, according to the attributes assigned to her by hymns, analects and lauds ever since the Middle Ages. The mother and child are linked, more than by the tender embracing gesture, by the rapt, reflective gaze with which the Madonna engulf her son. The painting is the prototype from which various similar compositions derive, such as the Madonna and Red Angels of the Accademia in Venice, with the child seated on the Virgin's left knee	BELLINI, Giovanni	Madonna and Child	Oil on panel, 83 x 66 cm	1480-90	religious	Italian	1451-1500

15735-ceiling.jpg	With the Peace of Bratislava (1805), Venice was incorporated into the French Empire. It was decided that a new sovereign's residence was required for Napoleon and the viceroy, Eugène de Beauharnais. Once the idea of converting the Palazzo Ducale had been abandoned, the notion was mooted to use the Procuratie Nuove and the Libreria Marciana for this purpose.Apart from Giuseppe Borsato, there were also a number of famous non-Venetians involved in decorating the royal palace. Felice Giani was given the task of painting the new apartment for the viceroy made out of the Libreria Marciana. His figures, full of self-confidence enlivened by quick-witted elements set against the whimsical ornamental scheme by Gaetano Bertolani, contain references to Herculaneum and neo-Renaissance motifs.The picture shows the ceiling decoration for the viceroy's apartment in the former Libreria Marciana	GIANI, Felice	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	1813	other	Italian	1801-1850
19908-06henry8.jpg	"This painting was one of a group of English portraits carried out by Holbein and his school. Though German, Holbein was court painter to King Henry VIII of England, and the prototype for this image is his lost mural that once decorated the Privy Chamber of Whitehall Palace in London. Carried out in 1537, that wall painting depicted the king with his third wife Jane Seymour, the only one of Henry's queens to bear him a male heir. Of the numerous paintings derived from that prototype, including a copy at Windsor Castle, this is without doubt the one of highest quality. The closest example to the prototype, on the other hand, is the portrait in the Thyssen collection in Madrid, which this version approaches especially in the rendering of the details of the collar (these passages were later modified, as is visible through reflectography).The Barberini portrait depicts the king in the same costume that he wore for his April, 1540, wedding to Anne of Cleves. The painting can thus be related to Duren's 1539 marriage portrait of Anne of Cleves (Louvre Museum, Paris), carried out in small dimensions and on canvas as it was meant to be transported.The attribution of the Rome version has been the subject of much discourse. It was considered to be an autograph work of Holbein, a copy of a lost original, the work of the master's workshop, the work of a close collaborator. An official engraving cut after this composition (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), adherent in its details to the Barberini picture, confirms the importance of this version of the image to the iconography of the king. Moreover, reflectographic examination of the painting has revealed characteristic underdrawing and other details that strongly suggest that the work is an autograph Holbein.The painting bears the inscription ""ANNO ETATIS SUAE XLIX"" (His year of age, 49)."

32185-ricardus.jpg	Two Flemish court painters of Bruges descent who earned their reputation abroad, Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569-1622) and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1562-1636), were active at the close of the sixteenth century and especially in the first quarter of the seventeenth. They are linear descendants of famous Bruges painter families. Their solid, old-fashioned technique and the rigid, immovable expression of their figures seem more like an extension of the sixteenth century than a herald of the seventeenth.Frans Pourbus the Younger was Pieter Pourbus' grandson. He was trained in Antwerp and worked briefly for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella before going on to become court painter at Mantua, under Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, and in Paris, under Marie de' Medici and Louis XIII. Until about 1600, Pourbus painted in the smooth and technically brilliant style established by his grandfather, which he augmented with an analytical realism attributable to Adriaan Key. The Portrait of Petrus Ricardus, a famous doctor and professor at the University of Leuven, is a good example of his first period	POURBUS, Frans the Younger	Portrait of Petrus Ricardus	Oil on oak panel, 107 x 77 cm	1592	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

30311-maggiore.jpg	Pannini was one of the most accomplished vedutisti (view-painters) of the eighteenth century. He came from a long tradition of Emilian view-painters and scenery-painters. In 1715 he moved to Rome where he first worked as a decorator painting counterfeit architecture in various palaces. He then found a fuller creative voice by painting scenes of holidays or special events. The spectacular backdrops he used for these works were the squares and buildings of Rome. The beauty of these monumental backgrounds, bathed in clear light that seemed to exalt the very notion of the Eternal City, was so powerful that he had no need of a narrative pretext for them. Many of Pannini's paintings are simple views animated by lively little figures. He had a considerable influence on Canaletto and the great Venetian view-painters of the eighteenth century.

35394-05resur.jpg	Rubens painted this triptych, called Moretus triptych, in 1611-12, shortly after completing the Raising of the Cross, and at more or less the same time as the centre panel of the Descent from the Cross. Martina Plantin, widow of the printer Jan Moretus of the Plantin Press, placed the commission.Christ strides powerfully from his open, rocky tomb rather than the customary sarcophagus. The supernatural radiance of his body contrasts with the darkness that shrouds the astounded soldiers. The panel on the left shows John the baptist, Jan Moretus' patron saint, in his camel-hair tunic by the River Jordan. The sword at his feet is an allusion to his beheading. St Martina, patron saint of Moretus' widow, holds the palm branch that symbolises the martyr.

24109-95magi.jpg	Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame.The subject of Adoration of the Magi was one of the most popular in all fifteenth-century art, especially for the opportunities it presented for the display of rich costumes and accessories, and of numerous subordinate figures with horses and other animals in an extensive landscape. Mantegna, however, restricts his composition to just six figures - with the three magi on the right converging on the three members of the Holy Family on the left - which he shows in half-length, and hence, too, in powerfully expressive close-up. Four decades earlier, when still working as a young man in Padua, Mantegna had introduced this type of half-length devotional narrative into Italian painting with his Presentation in the Temple.It was suggested that this painting was executed for Isabella d'Este, the consort of Marquis Francesco Gonzaga	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Adoration of the Magi	Distemper on canvas, 55 x 71 cm	1495-1505	religious	Italian	1451-1500
16534-s_jerome.jpg	This panel is from the upper register of a reconstructed polyptych. The companion panels in the upper register show Sts Sebastian and Peter, the Crucifixion and St Lawrence. The main panels with which the upper register has been framed since 1925 represent the Madonna and Child with angels, flanked by, on the left, Sts Augustine and Catherine of Alexandria and, on the right, Sts Appolonia and Nicholas of Tolentino.St Jerome is the most moving of the figural panels in the upper register. He is shown with his symbol, the lion, placing its paws on the saint while licking him as would a dog. Jerome is scrutinizing the text of the Vulgate, which he holds in front of him. Staring at the text through gilded pince-nez, his brows knitted in concentration, he reads aloud, his mouth half open, revealing white teeth.The panels forming the upper register come from the Benedictine abbey in Gualdo Tadino, which must have been the original location of the altarpiece to which they belonged	GIOVANNI ANGELO D'ANTONIO	St Jerome	Tempera and gold on panel, 154 x 43 cm	1463-64	religious	Italian	1451-1500

23397-8bathing.jpg	Painting nudes was one of the favourite genres of Károly Lotz, especially during the 1890s he painted several nudes. His female nudes are generally very sensuous, with natural beauty radiating from their gestures. This particular nude is a little abstract; her posture, the cape over the shoulder, and the black stone vessel are reminiscent of the cool grace of Ingres's nudes	LOTZ, Károly	Bathing Woman	Oil on canvas, 180 x 70 cm	1901	other	Hungarian	1851-1900
11256-103delac.jpg	The first of Delacroix's paintings to achieve true notoriety, Dante and Virgil in Hell or The Barque of Dante, exemplifies a duality that pervaded his entire career. The shared influence of Michelangelo and Rubens is manifest here, but there is also a savour of the revolution so thunderously proclaimed by his friend and elder, Theodore Géricault, in his immortal painting, The Raft of the Medusa (1819).The Barque of Dante was submitted to the Salon in 1822, and makes clear acknowledgement of its debt to Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa. Indeed, the influence of that painting can be traced for many years afterwards in Delacroix's work, for example, in his Christ on the Lake of Gennesaret (1854) or The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840). The 'stage-setting' of The Barque of Dante looks forward to Baudelaire's pronouncement that Delacroix is an 'essentially literary' painter. But Delacroix had something much more important to leam from the Raft. In expressing the predicament of the shipwrecked everywhere in the world, Géricault had laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution. The Raft of the Medusa marks the first appearance in painting of 'the ugly' and thereby proclaims its scrupulous respect for the truth, however repulsive the truth might be. This concern for truth is integral to the Romantic temperament.	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	The Barque of Dante	Oil on canvas, 189 x 246 cm	1822	other	French	1801-1850

35185-portuga1.jpg	Antonio Rossellino and his workshop played an important role in the creation of the burial chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal. This elaborate undertaking was the result of the collaboration of an architect (Antonio Manetti), four sculptors (Antonio Rossellino, his brothers Bernardo and Giovanni, and Luca della Robbia), three painters (Alesso Baldovinetti, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo), their workshops, and other craftsmen as well, and yet the chapel today - which looks exactly as it must have looked in the 1470s - is a stylistically unified totality rather than a demonstration of the diverse talents of a number of individuals.James (Jaime), a prince of the Portugal royal family who was made a cardinal at twenty-two, died of tuberculosis in Florence when he was only twenty-five. He had expressed a desire to be buried at San Miniato, and immense sums poured in for his funerary chapel.The chapel was designed by Antonio Manetti, a pupil of Brunelleschi, and the architectural detail was carved by Giovanni Rossellino, third of the five Rossellino brothers. The tomb was designed by Antonio Rossellino, who was helped in the execution by his brother Bernardo, and several assistants. On the altar wall Antonio del Pollaiuolo's frescoed angels pull back curtains that can be related to the curtains that surround Rossellino's tomb on the right wall. The painted altarpiece representing three saints is a work by Antonio del Pollaiuolo (presently a copy, the original being in the Uffizi). On the left wall facing the tomb (not shown in this picture), Alesso Baldovinetti's Annunciation is placed. Baldovinetti decorated also the lunettes and spandrels of the chapel. The inlaid marble floor copies the Cosmati work found in the adjacent church; this pattern is echoed in the composition of Luca della Robbia's enamelled terracotta dome above, which has five medallions representing the Cardinal Virtues and the Descent of the Holy Ghost	ROSSELLINO, Antonio	View of the Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal	White and coloured marbles, width of chapel 480 cm	1460-73	interior	Italian	1451-1500

14432-106fried.jpg	The Cross in the Mountains (The Tetschen Altar) brought Friedrich to the attention of a wider public. Probably at no other point in his life did Friedrich enjoy more profound appreciation and greater admiration than in the years around 1810. Two landscapes in particular were responsible for thrusting Friedrich into the limelight. In 1810 they were exhibited as pendants at the Academy exhibition in Berlin, where they were purchased by the Prussian king Frederick William III. These two paintings were The Monk by the Sea and the Abbey in the Oakwood.The Abbey in the Oakwood is an expression of grief at the loss of a great past. The artist has chosen to depict an architectural ruin; it may testify to the sublimity of the past, but it is a monument in a graveyard.The Napoleonic invasion of Germany and the consequent War of Liberation had added a patriotic dimension to Friedrich's subjects of north German ecclesiastical buildings in ruins or, in imagination, raised again. While the essential message of the Abbey in the Oak-wood of 1810 is the passing of the earthly life, its fog-bound ruin and blasted, leafless trees inevitably evoked the contemporary state of Germany.The painting was exhibited with its companion picture, the Monk by the Sea. This suggests the hope of resurrection in its bright sky, in contrast to the dark clouds that loom above the figure on his Baltic shore	FRIEDRICH, Caspar David	The Abbey in the Oakwood	Oil on canvas, 110 x 171 cm	1809-10	landscape	German	1801-1850

14039-altarpie.jpg	Formerly in Santa Maria delle Grazie at Bergamo, it was removed to the Brera in 1811. The predella and the crowning panel were acquired from the Albani collection in 1811. It is not certain that the predella and the crowning element originally formed part of the same altarpiece; and the accuracy of the entire reconstruction is in doubt. The panels are the following:Central panel: Madonna and Child (165 x 80 cm); side panels: Sts Jerome, Alexander, Vincent, Anthony (137 x 39 cm each); upper side panels: Sts Clare, Bonaventura, Louis, Bernardino (126 x 40 cm each); upper centralaa panel: St Francis (128 x 82 cm); predella panels showing scenes from the Life of Christ (87 x 30 cm each) and two Angels in Adoration (27 x 29 cm each).This altarpiece belongs to Foppa's early stylistic maturity and retains the archaising tendency toward simplification of his youthful period, before he was influenced by Leonardo and Bramante. It also shows the pungent impetuosity of Mantegna's influence in the sharply drawn perspective, and in the tension and almost metallic consistency of the forms. In this resplendent altarpiece, the central panels are particularly fine examples of Foppa's masterly interweaving of colour and light. The Madonna's face, lightly thrown into relief, concludes a series of circling motifs enhanced by the elegant twist of the body of the Child, as he leans over to pluck the string of the lute. In the panel above, St Francis appears as a motionless, somewhat astonished figure immersed in the limpid air of a lyric landscape	FOPPA, Vincenzo	Altarpiece	Tempera on panel	1476	religious	Italian	1451-1500
23474-danishco.jpg	The painting shows a view from Kitnas on Roskilde Fjord, Zeeland. When the painter decided to depict a Danish coastline in an unusually monumental format, the scene was to represent the quintessential characteristic of the Danish countryside: the extensive coastlines. The scene does not, in fact, depict a single, specific site, the main motif is based on cliffs that the artist saw and sketched at the Roskilde Fjord. He adapted these cliffs, making them rather more monumental, and combined them with scenes from elsewhere	LUNDBYE, Johan Thomas	A Danish Coast	Oil on canvas, 189 x 256 cm	1843	landscape	Danish	1801-1850

20645-skagen.jpg	Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris, the modern metropolis with its many-sided art scene. They attended the school of Léon Bonnat, or the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-Léon Gérôme. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grèz-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.Johansen painted with Monet's influence still fresh. Sheep are grazing in the foreground, while on the horizon, which divides the picture in two, we see Skagen with its mill, lighthouse, and the yellow-painted houses with their red tiled roofs	JOHANSEN, Viggo	Near Skagen ?sterby after a Storm	Oil on canvas, 95 x 147 cm	1885	landscape	Danish	1851-1900
11933-painting.jpg	Doré is best known today for his book illustrations, but he himself was most committed to his work as a painter. In 1873-74 he visited Scotland, which inspired him to produce a number of landscapes, including this depiction of a steep gorge. This is a typical example of late Romanticism, a grandiose panoramic mountain landscape, its vast scale indicated by the tiny trees and animals on the slopes	DORÉ, Gustave	Gorge	Oil on copper, 109 x 170 cm	1878	landscape	French	1851-1900
11130-early21.jpg	"Horse racing, a sport of English origin, became popular on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century, and soon inspired such painters as Carle Vernet and Théodore Géricault, who were both influenced by English artists. It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators. This led to the At the Races in the Countryside.Degas never tires of the theme of the racecourse. On September 27, 1881, the newspaper ""Le Globe"" started publishing Major Muybridge's photographs of a galloping horse, and Degas used them for his sketches. The photographs showed that traditional English prints were inaccurate when depicting galloping horses with their front legs outstretched. This is how Degas painted the horses racing in the background of At the Races in the Countryside of 1869.Degas exhibited this moderately colourful work at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The race itself is in the background, the foreground is occupied by a family scene centred on a baby, with the nurse, mother, father and even the dog atop the box. The family is the Valpinçon family: the driver of the carriage is Degas's friend Paul Valpinçon, who is shown with his wife, a wet nurse, and in the nurse's lap, the couple's son, Henri. The people in the carriage are caught in their fashionable elegance"	DEGAS, Edgar	At the Races in the Countryside	Oil on canvas, 37 x 56 cm	1869	other	French	1851-1900

33934-atalanta.jpg	In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions.In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her.There are two versions of this paining, one in Naples and another in Madrid, and recently there have been heated debates about both their autography and dating. While most scholars recognize the Madrid canvas as an autograph work, there have been serious reservations about the Neapolitan canvas, deemed it a workshop copy.

12114-du_barry.jpg	"Jeanne Bécu, comtesse du Barry (1743-1793), was the mistress of Louis XV. She was the natural daughter of a poor woman of Vaucouleurs. Placed in a convent in Paris at an early age, she received a very slight education, learning little but the catechism and drawing; and at the age of sixteen entered a milliner's shop in the rue St Honoré. Subsequently she lived as a courtesan under the name of Mlle Lange. Her great personal charms led the adventurer Jean, comte du Barry, to take her into his house in order to make it more attractive to the dupes whose money he won by gambling. Her success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a higher flight, and through Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV, and the duc de Richelieu, he succeeded in installing her as mistress of the king. In order to present her at court it was necessary to find a title for her, and as Count Jean du Barry was married, his brother Guillaume offered himself as nominal husband. The comtesse du Barry was presented at court on the 22nd of April 1769, and became official mistress of the king.Her influence over the monarch was absolute until his death in 1774 when an order of his successor banished her to the abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, but, the queen interceding for her, the king in the following year gave her permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Here she led a retired life with the comte de Cosse-Brissac, and was visited there by Benjamin Franklin and the emperor Joseph II, among many other distinguished men.Having gone to England in 1792 to endeavour to raise money on her jewels, she was on her return accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal of having dissipated the treasures of the state, conspired against the republic, and worn, in London, ""mourning for the tyrant."" She was condemned to death by guillotine on the 8th of December 1793, and beheaded the same evening.By the time the comtesse du Barry had arrived at Versailles, Drouais had completed posthumously the last portrait of Madame de Pompadour, a sumptuous affair that surely qualifies as his masterpiece. It was fitting that the new royal paramour would choose as her official portraitist an artist who could immortalize her predecessor with such refinement and elegance. She commissioned him to paint for both the ch&#226;teau and the pavilion of Luciennes a series of delightful pictures. During the comtesse du Barry's years at court, Drouais created five distinct portraits of her, as well as additional copies of the five images"	DROUAIS, François-Hubert	Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry	Oil on canvas, 71 x 59 cm	1770-74	portrait	French	1701-1750

03597-1trinity.jpg	In a theme that was majestically treated by Masaccio a century earlier, Beccafumi does not retain an orderly sense of scale for his figures, so that God the Father and the crucified Christ are much smaller in relation to the side saints (Sts Cosmas and John the Baptist at left, Sts John the Evangelist and Damian at right). All of his figures seem to deny pure volumetric presence, this despite the fact that Beccafumi was accomplished both as a bronze sculptor and painter	BECCAFUMI, Domenico	Trinity	Oil on wood, 152 x 228 cm	1513	religious	Italian	1501-1550
02618-03arella.jpg	While paintings of flowers in a vase represented the most conventional type of flower piece in the 17th century, in the pair of Vase of Flowers, now in the same private collection, Arellano has depicted particularly rich arrangements in remarkably ornate bulbous glass vases with gilt mounts. The paintings could be surrogates for actual flower arrangements in the homes of wealthy contemporaries.The apparently natural floral arrangements seen in these paintings were the result of Arellano's careful ordering of the flowers. He derived this type of composition from his study of earlier Flemish flower paintings and prints, and varied it little throughout his career. It is hard to distinguish the flowers he painted from nature from those deriving from other pictures, graphic sources, memory and practice.While the repetitive nature of Arellano's still-lifes would not have been noticed in his own time, when his works were dispersed among different collections, this factor is augmented in pictures united by photography and exhibitions	ARELLANO, Juan de	Vase of Flowers	Oil on canvas, 82 x 62,5 cm	1664	still-life	Spanish	1601-1650
10201-charity1.jpg	From 1529 Lucas Cranach the Elder, and his son Lucas the Younger depicted the Christian virtue of Love, Caritas or Charitas, in some dozen different versions. It happened only in individual pictures, where Caritas (Charity) does not appear in the company of the seven (or more) virtues and vices. The earlier clothed personification - the idealised figure of a woman - has been replaced by the picture of a young mother. She sits in blissful nakedness on a stone bench, her legs modestly crossed, with only a thin veil covering her head and shoulders. She breastfeeds her baby and allows two somewhat larger boys to cling on her.This composition later appeared in many other versions. The present version is amongst the earliest of Cranach's numerous variants of Caritas pictures. It is signed and of high quality	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Caritas (Charity)	Oil and tempera on wood	1534	religious	German	1501-1550
29883-emmaus.jpg	"The Supper at Emmaus is set in a contemporary inn as in the famous composition of Caravaggio and thus it is genre-like.

However, the colours shows the Spanish 'tenebroso"" tint.Variants of similar quality are in Bilbao museum and in Madrid, private collection.

37514-5eccehom.jpg	This painting (presently on loan to the Brera from a private collection) can be considered one of the most refined of the panel paintings by Sodoma.The picture highlights the half-length figure of Christ, whose bound hands are crossed in front of his naked breast.

06021-3triumph.jpg	The most prestigious commission Salomon de Bray ever received was for three paintings for Amalia van Solms's country seat, Huis ten Bosch. Jacob van Campen and Constantijn Huygens were responsible for the decoration of the large centrally located Oranjezaal. The Triumphal Procession with Musicians was the first canvas de Bray completed. The second, likewise a triumphal procession was finished a year later. Finally, in 1651, he painted a grisaille of putti.

19927-12chambe.jpg	John Chambers was 88 years old when Holbein executed this portrait. The close similarity of the sitter with the man identified as Chambers in the barber surgeons' picture (on Henry's right) allow a definite identification.

06682-v_lawyer.jpg	Pieter Breughel the Younger (the sons adopted a different spelling of the family name) specialized in copies of his father's work, though he ought really to be pictured as the head of a workshop in which a number of painters were employed. Some of these were more talented than others, which explains the substantial differences in quality between the many copies ascribed to him. The Village Lawyer, dated 1621, is believed to be an original work by Pieter the Younger rather than a copy. It too proved very popular and many versions of it have survived	BRUEGHEL, Pieter the Younger	Village Lawyer	Oil on panel, 74,8 x 122 cm	1621	genre	Flemish	1551-1600
34269-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.Undoubtedly Sebastiano Ricci's dashing virtuoso technique had its roots in the Baroque. In his hands, however, it was translated into an explosive, light-hearted energy.	RICCI, Sebastiano	Fall of Phaethon	Oil on canvas	1703-04	religious	Italian	1701-1750

07213-canal501.jpg	The painting depicts the scene when the doge, accompanied by the senators, visits the church and Scuola di San Rocco on the occasion of the feastday of the Saint.The church of San Rocco at the right has housed the body of St Roch since 1485. In 1576 there was a very severe outbreak of the plague in Venice, and it was thought that his intercession prevented an even greater calamity, so from that year onwards his Feast day, 16 August, was celebrated by the Republic. Canaletto here depicts one aspect of the festivities - a procession of resplendent dignitaries emerging from the church after they have attended Mass.The Scuola di San Rocco dominates the centre of the composition; its exterior is decorated with garlands and paintings, as was the custom on this occasion. Canaletto and his artist nephew Bellotto are recorded as having sold some of their works at one of these exhibitions. Many of the figures walking before it and beneath the awning can be identified because of their distinctive and colourful clothes. They are, from left to right: Secretaries, who wear mauve; the Doge's chair- and cushion-bearers; the Cancelliere Grande who wears scarlet; the Doge himself in gold and ermine; the Guardiano Grande di San Rocco; the bearer of the sword of state; the Senators; and finally the Ambassadors. A number of them carry nosegays, which were presented as reminders of the plague; they were carried during outbreaks of the disease because it was believed that their scent helped prevent its spread.Canaletto shows an expansive view of this scene which could not, in fact, be observed, because the church of the Frari impinges too far on the near side of the square.

10399-05adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht Dürer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike Dürer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Eve	Oil on lime wood panel, 171 x 63 cm	after 1537	religious	German	1501-1550
41182-zhairy1.jpg	"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome.

37586-salome.jpg	The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-8, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

Her face is pale, her eyes gaze upwards in yearning. We can sense the pain she has experienced and her mourning for her son.

35291-youngirl.jpg	Pietro Rotari, born in Verona, was one of the Venetian Settecento masters who travelled extensively. His enchanting genre pieces, his half-length portraits of young girls enjoyed wide popularity, particularly in Vienna, Dresden and later in St. Petersburg, where the artist stayed for several years. He also painted large religious compositions and mythological scenes, but his fame rested on the small pictures usually produced in series, in which, as in the Budapest painting, a pretty young girl was represented with a distaff or reading a letter, perhaps slumbering or leaning over her book. In these works an appealing pose was coupled with fine, pure design and warm colouring	ROTARI, Pietro Antonio	Young Girl with Distaff	Oil on canvas, 48 x 39 cm	-	portrait	Italian	1701-1750

35735-waterfa.jpg	This is one of Ruisdael grandest landscapes.After Ruisdael had settled in Amsterdam about 1656-57 his compositions broaden, and a certain heaviness in the foreground disappears. The opening of the view suggests that he was impressed by Philips Koninck's panoramic views, but the fresh atmospheric effect, the brilliant glittering daylight which brightens the landscapes, the reflections, and vivid colours in the shadows are completely personal. In the late fifties Ruisdael also began to represent waterfalls in mountainous northern valleys, and in the sixties they became an important theme in his oeuvre. This motif was popularized by Allart van Everdingen after he returned to Holland in 1644 from a trip to Norway and Sweden, and Ruisdael, who never visited Scandinavia, derived his torrential falls in northern landscapes from Everdingen's art	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Landscape with Waterfall	Oil on canvas, 101 x 142 cm	c. 1670	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
09848-courb111.jpg	"The subtitle of the huge painting is Real Allegory of Seven Years of My Artistic and Moral Life. Courbet did not like to talk about his art, but made an exception for this work: ""It is the moral and physical story of my studio. ... it is the world that comes to be painted. .. .The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are... friends... On the left, the other world of trivial life...""In 1854, Courbet began work on The Studio which he would like to submit for the Exposition universelle. Courbet described the painting in a letter: ""I see society with its concerns and passions; it is the world that comes to be painted.... The scene takes place in my atelier in Paris. The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are the shareholders, that is, friends, workers, devotees of the art world. On the left, the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.""The Studio presents a completely original synthesis and a thoroughly unexpected confrontation. There is no parallel in Courbet's later career for this generous, indeed baroque, vision, in which models and minds come together. Courbet sought to present the studio as an overall image of the role of art. He declared the autonomy and subjectivity of his perception in the face of history and the real world, both of which he had in his own way summoned into the studio. The master of ceremonies is seen painting a landscape, a practice that was to become increasingly central during the rest of his life. Meanwhile, the notion of a group portrait as homage or allegory in the spirit of Frans Hals, Rembrandt or Philippe de Champaigne, is perfectly achieved.The painting was a success at the Exposition, however, it did not find a buyer, remaining rolled up in a corner of the rue Hautefeuille studio till 1881, when Courbet's sister Juliette, his sole heir, decided to sell it. By then it had become something of a burden. It raised 21,000 francs (some 3,200 euros).

38536-2allegor.jpg	Abraham van den Tempel painted a series of three allegorical history pieces for the governors of the Lakenhal, or Clothmakers' Hall in Leiden between 1648 and 1651. The commission was a prestigious one, not only because of the size of the pictures, but also because they were history pieces to be displayed in a high ranking public building. The governors who commissioned the work were men of considerable stature, too. They were entrusted by the city fathers with the day-to-day management of one of Leiden's nine textile sectors, known in Dutch as 'neringen'. In this capacity they were responsible for the manufacture of and trade in worsted, a sector that was booming at the time. Their seat of office was the brand-new building which has been known to this day as the Lakenhal. They wanted classicist decorations worthy of their modern building.Regarding the series, Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden originally served as the overmantel, while the other two, Mars Banishes 'Nering' and The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' hung on the long wall beside one another. The latter two paintings form pendants, being the same size and related in subject-matter. The theme that connects them is 'nering', the term formerly used in Leiden for the production of and trade in textile.Whereas the Mars Banishes 'Nering' illustrates the misfortune caused by war, the painting The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' embodies the antithesis, where freedom, justice and peace foster trade and industry. Here Minerva and Mercury return as witnesses of the principal scene in which the Maid of Leiden stands on a step in her purple gown and crimson mantel and extends a hand to Nering, while Liberty, with her broken weapons and the hat symbolising freedom, kneels at her feet. Under her arm Nering clutches a bound volume containing the statutes establishing the worsted nering in 1638	TEMPEL, Abraham van den	The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering'	Oil on canvas, 207 x 267 cm	1651	historical	Dutch	1651-1700
03546-05family.jpg	This is perhaps the most famous painting by Bazille. It depicts a family in the shade on a terrace at Méric, near Montpellier in the south of France. The painting was accepted at the 1868 Salon. The picture, showing Bazille's parents and relations, conveys a sense of family and of social status, a particular lifestyle, and a fresh response to Nature and light; in painting it, Bazille was also out to convince his family of his ability as an artist	BAZILLE, Jean-Frédéric	Family Gathering	Oil on canvas, 152 x 230 cm	1867	portrait	French	1851-1900
25082-doctors.jpg	The attribution of the fresco is debated. Originally Vasari attributed it to Cimabue, however, this attribution was rejected at the end of the 18th century. Since then some critics attributed it to Pietro Cavallini or one of his followers; Jacopo Torriti or a follower, the young Giotto or a follower.  In the four compartments of the vault in the entrance bay the artist portrays the four Doctors of Church together with their scribes: in the south (at the top of the illustration) St Augustine and opposite him, St Ambrose; in the east (to the left) St Jerome, and in the west St Gregory. The architectural structures jut up from below into the gold background. The painter conveys a definite idea of the intellectual work of these saints through the great attention to detail and the perspectival accuracy.The picture shows the vault before the 1997 earthquake	MASTER of the Isaac Stories	Vault with the Church Fathers	Fresco	c. 1295	religious	Italian	1251-1300

42510-hagar_is.jpg	A series of recent studies has led to something of a new attitude towards Flemish painting in the 18th century. Until fairly recently, the art of this period was considered to be rather inferior, despite the high artistic output, because of its perceived lack of innovation. On the one hand, Flemish artists of the 18th century continued to live off the inheritance of Rubens, whose art seemed unsurpassable. Artists such as Pieter Jozef Verhaghen worked entirely in the tradition of Rubens, and although he spent a few years in Italy, there are few traces of this in his work. His Hagar and Ishmael banished by Abraham, painted for the abbey at Tongerlo, has all the outward characteristics of a baroque painting, but lacks Rubens expressiveness. Meanwhile, other artists had fallen under the spell of France with its trend-setting rococo artists. This development was, however, rather out of character with Flemish artistic tradition	VERHAGHEN, Pieter Jozef	Hagar and Ishmael Banished by Abraham	Oil on canvas, 168 x 195 cm	1781	religious	Flemish	1751-1800

16101-mary07.jpg	"In the upper section of the lunette above the chancel arch God the Father enthroned is painted, while the sides of the lunette are occupied by the scene of the Annunciation.The border between painted and real space appears to have been breached in Giotto's frescoes. This characterizes the representation of God the Father at the top of the triumphal arch wall above the entrance to the choir. The heavens have opened and ranks of angels surround God the Father on his throne. Amongst the angels, who move elegantly, the depiction of God, with his delicately shimmering, bright robes and his hieratic face, gives the impression of his belonging to a different sphere.This particular effect is also the result of a different painting technique: God the Father is not painted as a fresco on the wall, but in tempera on a wooden panel. This ""door"" was presumably opened during the mystery plays performed to celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation, in order that the dove of Annunciation could fly out. The representation of the Annunciation directly below it is an indication of this. In a magnificent way, Giotto here combines the real architecture of the church interior with feigned, painted architectural elements to create a meaningful unity. To the right and left of the arch, the angel and Mary kneel in their respective buildings. It is only through the connecting architecture that tension is maintained within the depiction of the Annunciation, even over this great, daring distance and separation of figures, and that God the Father &#151; at the top of the triumphal arch &#151; is also included in the action. As far as form and content were concerned, Giotto was even here entering new territory"	GIOTTO di Bondone	No. 13 God Sends Gabriel to the Virgin	Fresco, 230 x 690 cm	1306	religious	Italian	1301-1350
10212-2nymph1.jpg	The resurgence of Gothic linear rhythms is fundamental for the whole of Cranach's later work, in which the borderline between sacred and mundane art is blurred. He represented female saints as beautiful and elegant ladies in fashionable dress and covered with jewelry. His  Reclining River Nymph at the Fountain (1518 Leipzig) shows with what assurance he translated a Renaissance model - Giorgione's Venus - into his personal language of linear arabesque. This work inaugurated a long series of paintings of Venus, Lucretia, the Graces, the Judgment of Paris, and other subjects that serve as pretexts for the sensuous female nude, in which Cranach appears as a kind of 16th-century François Boucher. There exists several copy of this painting made by the workshop of Cranach.

08628-s_emmaus.jpg	This Supper at Emmaus has been attributed to Philippe de Champaigne, although some art historians consider it to be the work of his nephew and pupil Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne (1631-1681 or 1684). Both artists were born in Brussels and settled in Paris. The Rubensian influence in Champaigne's work is tempered by a classical purity informed by both the artistic influence of Nicolas Poussin and de Champaigne's Jansenist beliefs. The artist performed a number of commissions for the Jansenist monastery of Port Royal, near Paris, including a painting of The Supper at Emmaus, possibly the version in Ghent. Jean-Baptiste may have painted the work for his master	CHAMPAIGNE, Philippe de	The Supper at Emmaus	Oil on canvas, 217 x 226 cm	-	religious	French	1601-1650
36142-february.jpg	"Sandrart, best known for his major art history published in 1675 under the title ""Teutsche Academie"" is one of the few artist-writers whose painterly oeuvre was on a par with his literary ambitions.For Prince Maximilian of Bavaria, Sandrart painted allegories of day and night as well as a cycle of twelve paintings of the months of the year for the dining room of the Old Palace in Schleissheim. The months, accompanied by verses, were widely distributed in the form of engravings. They are illustrated by life-size half figures set in landscapes or interiors and show characteristic activities associated with the respective seasons and surrounded by their natural attributes. November, under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius the hunter, shows a hunter's return. With his nervous dogs on a short leash and his catch slung over his shoulder, he is heading towards a castle in the middle distance. A keen wind tears the leaves from the trees and scatters them through the air.Landscape and genre, still-life and allegory are combined in a picture that epitomizes the month of November in concentrated form. Only briefly and in passing does the hunter glance to one side, and once more we find an allegorical personification of time passing"	SANDRART, Joachim von	February	Oil on canvas, 149 x 123,5 cm	1642	genre	German	1601-1650
03437-08lucill.jpg	An extraordinary burst of light bounces off the characters, casting silky reflections on the robes and making the gold glimmer. The painter produced this masterpiece when he was well into his middle age. It gives us tremendous insight into his enormously innovative power which fell between popular realism and magical effects. It is astounding to think Jacopo Bassano was able to produce paintings of this stature when he was so removed from the major centres of art	BASSANO, Jacopo	St Valentine Baptizing St Lucilla	Oil on canvas	c. 1575	religious	Italian	1551-1600
21928-6carnat.jpg	"A work that would seem to evoke the sketches of a young Leonardo freed from Verrocchio's tutelage, though nevertheless still affected by a passion and taste for the soft textures and dazzle of solid material (as practiced in the workshop of the Florentine artist), is the Madonna sometimes referred to as the Madonna of the Carnation or ""Madonna of the flowers"".This painting is a free variant of the Benois Madonna in the Hermitage, being more complex in its composition and spatial arrangement, though perhaps somewhat highflown and less spontaneous. How it arrived at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, after its acquisition by a private German collector, is unknown to us. What is certain is that after a comprehensible, temporary attribution to Verrocchio or his shop, art critics subsequently almost universally assigned the painting to Leonardo, a jjudgment backed up by the most recent research. In fact, the richness of the drapery, the vastness of the mountain scenery with purple and gold hues tingeing the foothills of peaks that fade into the sky, the vitality of the cut flowers in the crystal vase and the softness of the Child's flesh that foreshadows the tender putti of the Virgin of the Rocks, are elements that show a distancing from the more distinctive Verrocchiesque style and instead assume those formal and chromatic characteristics that would be the mature Leonardo's very own. Moreover, we should not overlook the striking similarities - in facial features and other details - with the Benois Madonna already mentioned (the gem fastening the Virgin's gown over her breast) and with the Uffizi Annunciation, works that in their figurative and expressive invention quite clearly reveal the stamp of Leonardo"	LEONARDO da Vinci	The Madonna of the Carnation	Oil on panel, 62 x 47,5 cm	1478-80	religious	Italian	1451-1500

33028-06forna.jpg	"Much of Raphael's energy during his last years was directed toward public activity, or at least toward commissioners who were influential in city life and life within the Papal States (he designed a villa, known as the Villa Madama, for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici). Furthermore, many critics attribute to him a series of compositions of the Holy Family and of Saints which were then executed by his followers. The famous portrait of a young woman, called La Fornarina, must also be viewed in this perspective, although it is signed, in Latin, ""Raphael from Urbino"". The signature is engraved on the thin ribbon that the girl wears just under her left shoulder. Tradition identifies her with Margherita Luti, a Sienese woman whom Raphael loved, the daughter of a baker from the Roman district of Santa Dorotea. The stiffness of her features and the heavy chiaroscuro effect make La Fornarina an almost certain workshop piece with the contribution of Raphael, for Raphael's own work from this period is far more delicate.There are several old copies of this painting, the most famous in the Galleria Borghese"	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	Portrait of a Young Woman (La Fornarina)	Oil on wood, 85 x 60 cm	1518-19	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

Victories before a temple approach athletes in front of a triumphal arch, these all'antica themes pertinent to the sitter's scholarly calling or pretensions. The action taking place in the background may be on his mind, as suggested by his downcast eyes.

18234-0504grec.jpg	Painted for the attic of the High Altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, Toledo, to go above the Assumption. Probably painted 1577-78, following the Assumption. It was El Greco's first commission upon his arrival in Toleedo in 1577. It gained great fame in Toledo, which was artistically rather archaic and provincial, and established a successful career for El Greco in the town.Here the reference is to Rome, rather than to Venice, and specifically to Michelangelo, developing the motif of the Piet&#224;. The general scheme of the composition of the Trinity, however, refers to Dürer's engraving of the same subject. The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. Form is more in evidence here than in the Assumption, especially in the Michelangelesque motif of the naked Christ (for which the artist probably drew inspiration from Michelangelo's  Piet&#224; for Vittoria Colonna), and it is only later that he treats his figures with the same freedom as draperies. Here the suggestion of weight in the supported Dead Christ is appropriate. The stress on the dead body of Christ, together with the clamorous mannerist colors and the rather loose composition of the figures, produces a feverish pathos.El Greco was not to repeat this subject	GRECO, El	The Trinity	Oil on canvas, 300 x 179 cm	1577	religious	Spanish	1551-1600

34278-3bathshe.jpg	Attended by four maids and on the far right, a boy with a mirror, Uriah's beautiful wife, Bathsheba, devotes herself to her elaborate toilette in an enclosed garden. The sight of Bathsheba inflamed King David's desire, and he is usually depicted in a palace-window in the background. Here, however, a maid approaches on the far left with a letter from the king.The painting dates from about 1725 and thus belongs to the artist's late period: its refinement of form and colour is reminiscent of the golden age of Venetian painting in the 16th century, in particular of Veronese. One of the most influential painters of his time, Ricci was well on the road to international success by the turn of the 17th century. His career took him to Parma, Bologna, Rome, Milan, Florence, Venice and London.

40944-11medusa.jpg	From an early point, museums endeavoured to add the name of Leonardo to their collections. As early as 1782 this panel in the museum's depository was linked to a head of Medusa by Leonardo da Vinci which Vasari mentions. It is likely, though, that a well-read Netherlandish artist had read the biographer's description of the monster that is said to have frightened Leonardo's father, and amalgamated it and an independent head of Medusa to produce this painting	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Head of Medusa	Oil on panel, 49 x 74 cm	16th century	other	Flemish	1551-1600

38600-kermis.jpg	Depictions of the 'kermis' or rural fair belong to an iconographic and compositional tradition founded in the Netherlands in about 1550 by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. So when David Teniers painted his first country fair in i637, his native town of Antwerp could already look back on an almost century-long tradition in this genre.The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn shown here demonstrates how Teniers had grown away from Adriaen Brouwer and developed his own style, distinguished primarily by a lighter overall tone and warmer, more radiant colours. The scale of his figures is somewhat reduced in his village scenes, so that they fit more convincingly into his broad, expansive landscapes with their subtly shaded atmospheres. The festivities are being held here in a square, bounded on two sides by a wooden fence, in front of a village tavern similar to that in many other Flemish kermis paintings. A path leads off to the left in the direction of Antwerp Cathedral, which gives the rural festivities a local and municipal frame of reference. The sky, with its vivid stretches of cloud and the gold-tinged light of the evening on the left, is given a special weight, which lends the scene a cool, airy atmosphere and a festive mood.The joyful, lively antics of the farmers are not based on Teniers's own observations, but are pieced together from the handed-down repertoire of motifs for this genre, which were constantly varied and modified. They include the musicians standing on their podium, the three couples doing a round dance in the foreground, the drunk who is being helped home by two farmers, and the man who is leaning by the fence in an attack of nausea. At the end of the canvas on the right edge we also see the motif of the 'unequal couple': Teniers had already used lecherous old farmers hugging young girls as a single motif for a painting	TENIERS, David the Younger	The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn	Oil on canvas, 93 x 132 cm	1641	genre	Flemish	1651-1700
19142-37malle.jpg	"The name ""Malle Babbe van Haarlem"", which could be translated as Silly Betty or Mad Meg of Haarlem, is inscribed on an old piece of stretcher let into the modern one supporting the canvas in Berlin. In 1653, the Haarlem burgomasters allowed the local ""Workhouse"" (which was both a house of correction and a charitable institution) 65 guilders to care for Malle Babbe. The document also refers to Frans Hals mentally impaired son, Pieter, who had been confined in the same place since 1642. Thus a real person served as the model for Hals's painting in Berlin and for a number of related works. The owl was a common symbol of folly in the Netherlands, despite its classical association with Minerva, goddess of wisdom.This picture shows Hals supreme mastery of one of the principal preoccupations of Baroque artists: the rendering of instantaneous emotion and movement. No seventeenth-century artist surpassed Hals in this fields. Hals's vigorous concentration on this was more than an ordinary rendering of reality. He selected moments when human nature reveals all its vital energy. Most frequently he shows the instant when the joy of life is at its highest: the spontaneous laughter of a child, the smile of a courtesan, or the wild shriek of an old crone, like in this painting"	HALS, Frans	Malle Babbe	Oil on canvas, 75 x 64 cm	1633-35	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

23361-01lucret.jpg	"According to Roman legend, Lucretia, who was the wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, was raped by the son of the Roman king - a dishonour which subsequently resulted in her suicide. The event is supposed to have precipitated the collapse of the Etruscan royal line (510 BC) and thus to have led to the founding of the Roman Republic.In the 16th and 17th century Lucretia was frequently portrayed as a symbol of purity. Lotto presents us with the three-quarter view of a woman dressed in fine, richly trimmed clothes. Turned slightly away from the viewer, in her left hand she holds a drawing of the naked Lucretia about to stab herself in the heart. An inscription in Latin on the sheet on the table reads: ""Following Lucretia's example, no dishonoured woman should continue to live"".In the exquisiteness of its palette, the painting ranks amongst Lotto's greatest works. While the subject's face follows on from the tradition of Giorgione, the contrast between her brightly lit shoulders and the richly gradated reds and greens of her dress is worthy of a Titian. The costly pendant suspended from the gold chain, its precious stones refracting the light, is virtually without equal in 16th-century Venetian painting"	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Portrait of a Lady as Lucretia	Oil on canvas, 96 x 111 cm	1530-32	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
03195-aeneas.jpg	Federico Barrocci's Aeneas' Flight from Troy with Anchises, his son Ascanius and his wife Creusa is the second version painted in 1598 of a picture executed ten years earlier for Emperor Rudolf II of Austria. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere presented Cardinal Scipione with this second version, which entered the Borghese collection before 1613. It was this painting that inspired Cardinal Scipione to commission a large marble group on the same subject from Gian Lorenzo Bernini (also in the Borghese Gallery). The myth of Aeneas, ancestor of Romulus and Remus, referred to the birth of Rome and thus confirmed the Borghese family's high status in the city.Barrocci's many drawings of nature led him to achieve a spontaneity and naturalness in movement, colour and airy effects, and a silvery luminosity that was to influence the 17th-century masters, particularly Rubens. Never before had flames been painted so close to, with an energy suggesting even the crackle of the fire, from which Ascanius seems to be protecting himself by covering his ears. But the human delicacy of Barrocci's anti-heroic and anti-rhetorical figures was not to be really appreciated in Rome, because it could not compete with the classical antique statuary	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Aeneas' Flight from Troy	Oil on canvas, 179 x 253 cm	1598	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
09562-corot152.jpg	The austere yet in exhaustible range of silvery grey hues, together with the combination of a single mass of forest and lightly drawn tree, makes this painting characteristic of Corot's oeuvre. The figures in his late works appear to dissolve into nature. Here, the turn of the woman's body is presented so precisely that the entire landscape seems to be contained within her backward glance	COROT, Jean-Baptiste Camille	Peasant Woman Pasturing a Cow by the Edge of a Forest	Oil on canvas, 48 x 35 cm	1865-70	landscape	French	1801-1850
06485-01weddin.jpg	Painted about 1567, this picture has traditionally been thought of simply as a depiction of peasant life. However, it seems likely that, in addition to the obvious celebration of peasant life, the picture has a moral dimension - the celebration of the sacrament of marriage has simply become an excuse for self-indulgence. Whereas in his earlier engraved work Bruegel represented the Vices as elaborate allegories peopled by Boschian monsters, here human weakness is commented on in an understated, naturalistic and humorous manner.The wedding feast is dominated by the figure of the bride who, radiant and composed, presides over the table beneath a canopy. Less obvious is the identity of the bridegroom; he may be the man in black, with his back to the spectator, leaning back on his stool, mug in hand, calling for more wine. The feast is taking place in the barn, the wall behind the guests consisting of stacked-up straw or corn. Two ears of corn with a rake call to the mind work that harvesting involves. The plates are being carried around on a door taken off its hinges. The principal form of nourishment in those day consisted of bread, porridge and soup.A curious detail of the scene which has never been satisfactorily explained is the presence on the far right of a richly-dressed nobleman in earnest conversation with a monk. The monk has presumably just conducted the service of marriage and it has been suggested that he is tediously reminiscing about previous weddings he has attended to the local landowner.

10751-mormons.jpg	Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints first arrived in Denmark in June 1850. The painting, created only six years after their arrival, is set in the shadowed interior of a provincial cottage. A group of people are gathered around a table, listening to a missionary's message. Light filters in through a small window and an open door. It is a study of contemporary daily life, carefully depicting the interior and costumes of the people in detail	DALSGAARD, Christen	Mormons Visit a Country Carpenter	Oil on canvas	1856	genre	Danish	1851-1900

42222-0208vela.jpg	"The subject of the painting is the Greek philosopher Democritus expressing his amusement at the world, which stands on the table in front of him in the shape of a globe. The man in the picture stands there smiling, shown half-length, turned to one side but with his face towards us. His right hand is placed on his hip, in an attitude setting off the heavy folds of a red cloak.Democritus, who lived around 470-360 BC, taught that cheerful and moderate contentment was the way to happiness. European painting of the Renaissance and Baroque periods repeatedly portrayed him as the ""laughing philosopher"", contrasting him with other intellectual types such as the pessimist, the stoic and the cynic"	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Democritus	Oil on canvas, 101 x 81 cm	1628-29	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650
03914-207feas.jpg	"The Feast of the Gods was Giovanni Bellini's last great  painting and one of only a few that he executed on canvas. It was the first in a series of mythologies or bacchanals commissioned by Duke Alfonso d'Este to decorate the camerino d'alabastro, or alabaster study, of his castle in Ferrara. The artist, whose career began in the 1450s, was trained to paint on wooden panels, which require a very meticulous application of pigment. When he worked on canvas late in his career, Bellini retained his tight, precise brushwork. The flesh tones, iridescent silks, and even the foreground pebbles here demonstrate his delicate touch.According to the current interpretations, the scene illustrates a passage from Ovid's Fasti (The Feasts), a long classical poem that recounts the origins of many  ancient Roman rites and festivals. Ovid (43 B.C. - A.D. 17), describing a banquet given by the god of wine, mentioned an incident that embarrassed Priapus, god of  virility.The beautiful nymph Lotis, shown reclining at the far right, was lulled to sleep by wine. Priapus, overcome by lust, seized the opportunity to take advantage of her and is portrayed bending forward to lift her skirt. His attempt was foiled when an ass, seen at the left, ""with raucous braying, gave out an ill-timed roar. Awakened, the startled nymph pushed Priapus away, and the god was laughed at by all."" Priapus, his pride wounded, took revenge by demanding the annual sacrifice of a donkey.The ass stands next to Silenus, a woodland deity who used the beast to carry wood, thus wears a keg on his belt because he was a follower of Bacchus, god of wine. Bacchus himself, seen as an infant, kneels before them while decanting wine into a crystal pitcher.Reading from left to right, the principal figures are:Silenus, a woodland god attended by his donkeyBacchus, the infant god of wine crowned with grape leavesFaunus or Silvanus, an old forest god wearing a wreath of pine needlesMercury, the messenger of the gods carrying his caduceus or herald's staffJupiter, the king of the gods accompanied by an eagleAn unidentified goddess holding a quince, a fruit associated in the ancient world with marriagePan, a satyr with a grape wreath who blows on his shepherd's pipesNeptune, the god of the sea sitting beside his trident harpoonCeres, the goddess of cereal grains with a wreath of wheatApollo, god of the sun and the arts, crowned by laurel and holding a Renaissance stringed musical instrument, the lira da braccio, in lieu of a classical lyrePriapus, the god of virility and of vineyards with a scythe, used to prune orchards, hanging from the tree above himLotis, one of the naiads, a nymph of fresh waters who represents chastity.These deities are waited upon by three naiads, nymphs of streams and brooks, and two satyrs, goat-footed inhabitants of the wilderness. On the distant mountain, which Titian added to Bellini's picture, two more satyrs cavort drunkenly and a hunting hound chases a stag"	BELLINI, Giovanni	The Feast of the Gods	Oil on canvas, 170 x 188 cm	1514	mythological	Italian	1451-1500
24177-clement9.jpg	Apart from demonstrating the favours granted by important Roman patrons, Maratti's portraits are also perhaps the most lively and penetrating part of his work. He took pains to capture the exact physiognomy of his sitters in whom he sometimes seemed to uncover an incurable feeling of melancholy hiding just below the surface. Here his admiration for Raphael's portraits is evident, but he has added a more stylish air to suit the tastes of the high Baroque.The painting was executed shortly before the death of the Pope who was on the throne from 1667 to 1669. It is signed on the paper sheet on the table	MARATTI, Carlo	Portrait of Pope Clement IX	Oil on canvas, 158 x 119 cm	1669	portrait	Italian	1651-1700
15755-tobias_a.jpg	The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight	GIAQUINTO, Corrado	Tobias and the Angel	Oil on canvas, 58 x 48 cm	c. 1740	religious	Italian	1701-1750
11538-laidtabl.jpg	The aesthetically conservative principle of tables arranged strictly parallel to the horizontal edges of the painting was followed by Nicolaes Gillis and Floris Claesz van Dijck. (Predecessors were probably family paintings such as Marten van Heemskerck's.) Their still-lifes are classified as 'ontbijtjes' (breakfast still-lifes). Onbijt(je) was a light meal which could be taken at any time of the day. Strictly speaking, most of the paintings by Gillis and van Dijck are dessert still-lifes, developed at roughly the time by Osias Beert and Clara Peeters.All these artists show a table with a table runner and a carefully ironed, white damask tablecloth whose creases, regardless of the laws of perspective, run in parallel lines towards the back of the painting. A relatively high viewpoint was also chosen, apparently to afford a good overall survey of the objects, which are arranged side by side, or in a circle, hardly ever touching or overlapping. The precious drinking vessels and pieces of textile show very clearly that the arrangement is that of a privileged household.In accordance with etiquette, fruit, pies, nuts and confectionery were served as a dessert. Cheese, which had a central role in Gillis's and van Dijck's art, was also part of the dessert. Gillis and van Dijck build up pyramids of hard cheese in two or three layers: at the bottom there is half a large cheese with a rich, yellow hue, indicating that it is still very young, while on the top the cheeses are smaller and more brownish, almost grey in colour, showing that they are older and more mature. The irregular traces of cuts with a knife - the only piece of cutlery on the table - are rendered extremely well	DIJCK, Floris Claesz van	Laid Table	Oil on wood, 100 x 135 cm	1622	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
34260-bacchan2.jpg	The pair of canvases, depicting The Bacchanal in Honour of Pan and The Feast of Silenus, were commissioned by the celebrated patron of the arts, Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg (1661-1747). A German aristocrat and general of the Saxon and Venetian armies, Schulenburg settled in Venice upon his retirement where he began to amass a spectacular collection, acquiring paintings by the likes of Raphael, Giorgione and Correggio. In addition to the present canvases, Ricci painted two further versions of these pendants	RICCI, Sebastiano	Feast of Silenus	Oil on canvas, 99 x 114 cm	-	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
17035-flower08.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 213, JH 1247.Van Gogh arrived in Paris in March 1886. Although he was able to see a considerable amount of contemporary French painting by the Impressionists and their followers - Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte was exhibited twice in 1886 - he took little notice for at least a year. As a letter written to an English artist he had met in Antwerp reveals, he continued with what he had been doing in Antwerp. He enrolled again in an atelier, where he could draw and paint the nude from plaster casts and live models.Since he could ill afford to hire models, he painted large numbers of still-lifes of flowers in order to study the colour theory of Hals and Delacroix. He wrote that he was 'trying to render intense colour and not a grey harmony'. The present painting indicates to what extent he had accomplished this aim. It also demonstrates the now varied ways in which he applied his paint: dashes in the background to break up the blue field of the wall, directional brushstrokes on the table, impasto highlights on the metal vase. The plant itself is virtually drawn in colour; each leaf is a separate stroke and the heads of the flowers are depicted with more voluptuous and solid sweeps of paint	GOGH, Vincent van	Fritillaries in a Copper Vase	Oil on canvas, 74 x 61 cm	April-May 1887, Paris	still-life	Dutch	1851-1900

06439-12july.jpg	Neither the signature nor the date have survived on this panel, but it clearly belongs to the series of the Months, all the other panels of which are dated 1565. July and August are the months of the harvest, and this painting and the August panel (The Corn Harvest) show the bringing-in of the harvest. It is not just the grain that is being harvested but, as can be seen in the foreground, vegetables and berries as well. While each painting in the series shows the traditional occupation of that month, Bruegel's real subject is the landscape itself, its ever-changing appearance. There is a profound sense in which human activity is at best peripheral to the life of the landscape itself. Bruegel is concerned to show that the seasonal concerns of men are dictated by the land	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Haymaking (July)	Oil on panel, 117 x 161 cm	1565	landscape	Netherlandish	1501-1550

35367-05religi.jpg	The Oratorians commissioned a painting from Rubens for the high-altar of their main church, Santa Maria in Vallicella. Rubens painted the Ecstasy of St Gregory the Great, however, it was rejected on the ground that it reflected the light entering the church too strongly. For this reason the canvas was replaced by a new version on slate. This was quite different from the first painting; its composition was divided over three separate panels. This work, still in its original place in Santa Maria in Vallicella, was ready in autumn 1608	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Madonna Adored by Angels (Madonna della Vallicella)	Oil on slate, 425 x 250 cm	1608	religious	Flemish	1601-1650

24460-crucifix.jpg	On February 19th 1426 Masaccio agreed to paint an altarpiece for a chapel in the church of the Carmine in Pisa for the sum of 80 florins. On December 26th of that year the work must have been already completed since payment for it is recorded on this date. Vasari gave a detailed description of the work which was the basis for art critics for the attempt at reconstruction and for the recovery and identification of the work which was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century. Only eleven pieces have so far come to light and they are not sufficient to enable a reliable reconstruction of the whole work. The Crucifixion is one of the eleven panels (one of the top panels) connected with the Pisa Polyptych.As in the main panel, the Gothic arch determines the pictorial frame, the upward stress of which Masaccio modifies in his composition. To counter the vertical trust imposed by the arch, Masaccio creates a strong horizontal effect with the rather exaggerated extension of the arms of Christ on the cross. Although Masaccio still uses the gilt background for his representation, the atmospheric effects remain hauntingly convincing.

37004-service.jpg	The Grote Kerk in Weesp was originally a Catholic church consecrated to St Lawrence, in 1582 it became Protestant and its name was changed from Laurentiuskerk to Grote Kerk.For Dutch architectural painters the people in the church served as staffage to enliven the stone setting. This is different with Sibilla: for him the architecture is not central, but rather the depicted persons, who are very large in relation to the building. About seventy can be counted, a few of whom seem to be portraits. Certain elements, such as the dogs, bring a genre scene to mind. The combination of a church interior, group portrait, and genre scene is unique in Sibilla's oeuvre	SIBILLA, Gijsbert Jansz.

10194-adamev05.jpg	To the rigorous, perfectly Renaissance Dürer, troubled by the question of the proportions of the human body, Cranach, in his nudes, responds by freeing himself from every rule and from any observation of anatomical accuracy. His figures are elongated out of all proportion, seem boneless and are shown in affected, theatrical poses. The naked bodies, ivory-coloured against a dark background, emanate a totally cold, intellectual eroticism. The effect is accentuated in this work, for example, by the malicious gesture with which Eve holds out the apple, with her other hand bent unnaturally to hold the frond which covers her loins, but above all by the sly expression on her slightly cruel face.Attributed once to Albrecht Dürer, the work is documented in Florentine Medicean collections yet in 1688	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Adam and Eve	Oil on wood, 172 x 63 cm and 167 x 61 cm	1528	religious	German	1501-1550
21646-rinaldo1.jpg	The subject was inspired by the 16th-century epic poem 'Gerusalemme Liberata' (Jerusalem Delivered) by Torquato Tasso (1544-1595). Rinaldo and Armida are a pair of lovers in the poem which is an idealized account of the first Crusade which ended with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the establishment of a Christian kingdom. Armida, a beautiful virgin witch, had been sent by Satan (whose aid the Saracens had enlisted0 to bring about the Crusaders' undoing by sorcery. She sought revenge on the Christian prince Rinaldo after he had rescued his companions whom she had changed into monsters. The pastoral story of hate turned of love, of the lovers' dalliance in Armida's magic kingdom, and Rinaldo's final desertion of her, forms a sequence of themes that were widely popular with Italian and French artists in the 17th and 18th centuries.

25100-2sebasti.jpg	St Sebastian is standing frontally with his hands over his head tied to a tree in a tree-filled landscape with abundant vegetation in the foreground. The towers of a castle loom up in the background. Apart from his loincloth he is naked. Both sides of his body are pierced with arrows. The handling of light is full of contrast, with ample use of white lead on the rosy skin standing out against the very dark green of the surroundings.Various characteristics in the manner of painting and the style, as well as the conception, enable us to ascribe this hitherto unknown panel to the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. The stiff, marionette-like figures with heavily drawn features; the hard, richly contrasted palette; and the systematic use in his landscapes of stereotypical vegetation and towers or city views in the distance are typical of nearly all his compositions.In this St Sebastian all these elements are clearly visible. The physiognomy with the heavy nose and the rather oriental eyes with large, vaulted upper eyelids and bushy eyebrows is to be seen in several of his works, for example, the Lamentation in Minneapolis and in the Tallinn altarpiece. The flat folds of the loincloth can be compared with the Virgin's head-scarf in the Lamentation of the Thyssen Foundation, where Christ's torso has been modelled in much the same way. The manner in which the vegetation is treated is almost identical in the St John on Patmos of Rotterdam and in the Legend of St Lucy in St James' Church in Bruges.Owing to its small format, it can be suspected that the St Sebastian was the wing of a triptych. The painting on the reverse was probably planed away when the cradle was applied	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Lucy	St Sebastian	Oil on oak panel, 70 x 27 cm	1480-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
05199-11magici.jpg	The Magician belonging to Bosch's early paintings is now lost but it is known through a faithful copy at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. A mountebank has set up his table before a crumbling stone wall. His audience watches spellbound as he seems to bring forth a frog from the mouth of an old man in their midst; only one of the crowd, the young man with his hand on the shoulder of his female companion, appears to notice that the old man's purse is being stolen by the conjuror's confederate. The myopic gaze of the thief and the stupid amazement of the frog-spitting victim are superbly played off against the amused reactions of the bystanders, while the slyness of the mountebank is well conveyed in his sharp-nosed physiognomy. Bosch exploits the human face in profile for expressive purposes. Although the painting may possess a moralizing significance, it must have been inspired by a real-life situation closely observed. The perceptive, spontaneous humour of this little picture would be difficult to match in contemporary Flemish painting, but parallels can be found among Dutch manuscript illuminators	BOSCH, Hieronymus	The Magician	Oil on panel, 53 x 75 cm	1475-80	genre	Netherlandish	1451-1500

07957-farnes01.jpg	In 1597 Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Annibale Carracci's great masterpiece, the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese in the Palazzo Farnese, the most splendid and influential ceiling decoration in Rome since that of the Sistine Chapel. Annibale's brother Agostino assisted him on at least two of the scenes until they quarrelled and Agostino left Rome. In contrast to the earlier interpretation which saw them as a Neoplatonic allegory of the victory of Celestial Love over physical passion, in recent years Annibale's frescoes have generally been regarded as a witty and joyous celebration of the classical gods in love.During the 1570s and 1580s fresco cycles with mythological subjects had been relatively unfashionable in Rome, since the climate of the Counter Reformation favoured religious decoration, even in secular buildings such as palaces and villas. It may be a measure of the Catholic Church's confidence in winning the battle for souls that it could increasingly tolerate such overtly erotic decoration, even in a cardinal's palace, albeit in what was probably one of the more private rooms. Besides celebrating love's power to conquer, it is likely that the frescoes were intended to complement the antique statues, some of the finest in one of Rome's most magnificent collection of antiquities, which were displayed there	CARRACCI, Annibale	The Galleria Farnese	Fresco	1597-1602	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
37208-maesta_2.jpg	After a few years of Duccio's Maest&#224;, Simone painted his Maest&#224; for the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, as the ideal of the good and just government. This is the oldest painting that can be safely attributed to him. The end wall of the Sala del Mappamondo is entirely covered by this fresco. Surrounded by a frame decorated with twenty medallions depicting the Blessing Christ, the Prophets and the Evangelists and with smaller shields containing the coat-of-arms of Siena, the fresco shows a host of angels, Saints and Apostles, with the Madonna and Child in the centre. The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk.The most obvious innovations present in Simone's style are his ideas of three-dimensional space. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition. Under the canopy there is a crowd of thirty people: no more processions of people in parallel rows, but concrete spacial rhythms and animated gestures	SIMONE MARTINI	Maest?

00123-marketse.jpg	The painting is an Ecce Homo fragment. Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Scene	Oil on oak, 59,5 x 122,5 cm	c. 1550	still-life	Netherlandish	1501-1550

19512-luke_pai.jpg	Due to the fame of Rogier van der Weyden's St Luke Painting the Virgin, dozens of artists painted this subject over the next century, especially in the Low Countries and Germany. The composition and its content evolved over time as attitudes about art changed. Van Heemskerk created his version possibly as an altarpiece for Delft's St Luke's guild. The apparent influence of Michelangelo and the inclusion of antique sculptures indicates the stay of the artist in Rome. The painting harks back to Jan Gossart's St Luke Painting the Virgin in Prague, but now the background reflects his visits to courtyards in Rome that were full of recently unearthed antiquities	HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van	St Luke Painting the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 206 x 144 cm	1550-53	religious	Dutch	1501-1550
12980-grimaldi.jpg	The Genoese noblewoman is shown on the terrace of her palace. The soaring columns and cloud-swept sky add a sense of height and dignity to the majestic figure, while the brilliant red parasol relieves the otherwise somber colour scheme. The Genoese nobility, wealthy from the trade of its powerful merchant marine, had many ties with members of the Spanish court and adopted many customs from them, including the sumptuous but sober fabrics of courtly dress. Van Dyck, in these portraits of his Genoese period, has immortalized the dignity and splendid scale of living of his patrons	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Marchesa Elena Grimaldi Cattaneo	Oil on canvas, 243 x 139 cm	c. 1623	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
10300-06woman4.jpg	Margaret of Austria was one of the most significant female figures of the sixteenth century, and won the respect of his contemporaries by the conduct of her life and office (as the Governess-General and regent of the Netherlands. Her court painter Bernaert van Orley painted several official portraits of Margaret. Cranach's painting is based on van Orley, his source was, however, not one of the official portraits but a chalk drawing now in Berlin.The painter depicts the sitter in a white hood in the Netherlandish style.

40998-08virdol.jpg	"On grounds of the inscription on the cover of the twelve panels that had originally been fastened together to form a book, the picture is considered to be the work of a painter called ""Jaques Daliwe"", who probably had immigrated to France from the Low Countries and then worked beside the Limbourg brothers in the court of the Duc de Berry. (Though the name ""Daliwe"" could be also a reference to the proprietor.) The artist may have used the booklet as a note-book for about twenty years. In it he put down his memories, ideas and everything he saw and considered interesting while moving from one place to another. Often, as was the case with the drawing reproduced here, he composed homogeneous scenes from the different motifs in his individual manner.As a rule the seated lamenting figures of the Virgin and St John are represented below the crucified Christ. But here both Christ and the cross have been removed and only the two of them remain in the place of the Crucifixion. In front of them there are scattered the instruments of torture, whereas behind them - as though it were their common thought - the figure of the suffering Christ is to be seen surrounded by a cloud of angels. His face is distorted by pain, His head is bowed forwards and His crossed arms have slipped slightly sideways in the sarcophagus. The imagination of His mother and His favourite disciple have enlarged His figure into monumental dimensions, but the two react to the scene in different ways: the Virgin is leaning her face onto her hand and is engrossed in her thoughts; wrapped in her cloak, she stares into space. St John is more agitated and active, and raises his head passionately.The difference between the vision and the real scene is shown not only in the scale of the figures but also in the technique of drawing. The Virgin, St John and the ground are modelled with the most delicate tints of grey, while the paler figure of Christ is interpreted by more linear means, first of all with contours, whereas the host of angels is conveyed only by gossamer fine outlines. The drawing may have been a preparatory sketch to a painting, its composition being based on a strictly geometrical framework. The central axis of the picture is indicated by two nails lying in the foreground and meeting at their tips. If we, in our imagination, lengthen their lines up to the top corners we get two smaller triangles on the two sides and a larger one in the middle of the top. The former include the figures of the Virgin and of St John respectively, whereas the latter frames Christ's figure with the angels, whose whirling movements fill up the triangle standing on its point"	UNKNOWN MASTER, French	Vir Dolorum (Man of Sorrows)	Lead and tempera on wood, 8,7 x 12,6 cm	1400-20	religious	French	1401-1450

41312-01madonn.jpg	"Originally venerated in the convent church of Santa Maria in Campo Marzio (Rome) this painting is an icon: its miraculous powers are attested by Bombelli, in his 1792 engraving of the panel. Iconographically, the image is connected to the Constantinopolitan ""Haghiosoritissa"", a type of image in which the Virgin is represented in the act of interceding with Christ on behalf of the human race. The proposed dating of the painting to the middle of the twelfth century is generally accepted on the basis of stylistic similarities to a panel of the Last Judgment in the Pinacoteca of the Vatican Museums.Stylistically different from other Roman panels that depict the same subject, the painting has been assigned to the same hand that executed the Blessing Christ (Vatican Museums, Pinacoteca), a picture that also originally decorated Santa Maria in Campo Marzio. The two works are characterized by an accentuated linearism typical of Byzantine style and a monumental quality that is distinctly Roman. They show identical treatments of chiaroscuro effects, simplified folds of the drapery, and effects light. Also shared by the two paintings are the brown intonations in the face, which give little concession to colorism, and certain signature characteristics like the rapid brushwork with which the artist defines the folds of Christ's neck or the dark triangle that divides the eyebrows of the Virgin.The inscription at the bottom: ""SCA VIRGO VIRGINUM"""	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	The Madonna as Advocate (Haghiosoritissa)	Tempera on panel covered with canvas, 107 x 58 cm	1150s	religious	Italian	1151-1200
19819-portrai2.jpg	The two panels in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, representing the portraits of a man and a woman, reveal the artist's interest in depicting the physical characteristics of his sitters, both of whom have rather pronounced features. Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife. However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned. It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses	HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder	Portrait of a Man	Oil on panel, 24 x 17 cm	1518-20	portrait	German	1451-1500

It is probably by a copyist.The bearded sitter in this portrait rests his arms on a stone parapet and holds a rosary with a pomander attached. He wears a broad-rimmed hat over a gold cap, a fur coat over a black shirt and white undershirt, and a gold ring on the left index finger.

00960-03prede3.jpg	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece.

The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes	ANGELICO, Fra	The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in Heaven	Tempera and gold on panel, 26 x 53 cm	1434-35	religious	Italian	1401-1450

Doge Morosini brought it to Venice as a trophy after peace had been made with the Turks at the end of the Candia war. Tradition has it that the artist was St Luke the Evangelist and that it is consequently a miraculous sacred image, but it was actually the work of a 12th century Madonna painter.

In this panel, a woman gazes serenely as if lost in thought as she composes music, poised to record the notes played by her lute-strumming confidant behind the table. A man, perhaps an admirer, peers over her shoulder as she works. The room is extravagantly decorated from its wooden table bedecked with an expensive Turkish carpet to the eye-catching mantelpiece that mimics a real one in the Amsterdam Town Hall.

25926-cremona1.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the façade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the façade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515. Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative. The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.Melone continued the cycle on the right wall, he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists	MELONE, Altobello	Flight to Egypt	Fresco	1517	religious	Italian	1501-1550
22214-lot_daug.jpg	"The story of the destruction of Sodom, Lot's escape, and his subsequent seduction by his two daughters is told in Genesis. Lot and his family were allowed to leave the city on condition that they did not look back. Lot's wife disobeyed the instruction and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot continued on with his daughters. Since their husbands had not fled with them, the daughters said to each other: ""Our father is old and there is not a man in the country to come to us in the usual way. Come now, let us make our father drink wine and then lie with him and in this way keep the family alive through our father."" The sons born of this union subsequently founded the tribes of the Moabites and the Ammonites.Both as a strongly erotic group painting and as a history painting, the subject was a popular one in the 16th and 17th century. This painting, whose attribution to van Leyden - said to have executed his first commission at the age of twelve - is not altogether certain, falls into the second category. Alongside the group in the foreground, the destruction of Sodom seen in the left-hand background establishes a second point of focus. Influenced by Patenier, the painter portrays a kind of ""global landscape"" extending from the front left-hand corner into the depths of the composition.

12020-witchcra.jpg	The official painter of the Este court, Dossi painted the family portraits, filled castles with paintings and frescoed villas. This routine, which for other painters might have seemed mortifying, did nothing to extinguish the vivacious and brilliant vein of the artist. Dossi is always consistent. He flushes the flesh tones of his characters with orangy, reddish colours, he places them in risqué situations, with bare-chested women in convivial surroundings and almost obscene merrymaking men with such highly characterized faces that they are almost caricatures. The faces of the women and that of the faun are drawn directly from a cultured classical tradition which is inserted into the Mannerist context. The other characters, emerging from a humid, obscure background, are anything but stereotypes: healthy faces reddened by feasting, grimaces, a variety of attitudes. The only note of light - quite unreal - which stands out from the prevalently ruddy tones, falls directly onto the breasts of the woman holding a bowl of fruit	DOSSI, Dosso	Witchcraft (Allegory of Hercules)	Oil on canvas, 143 x 144 cm	1540-42	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

40185-allegory.jpg	In his large-scale pictures, De Troy tends to lose vivacity of touch, replacing it by a rather heavy handling which can yet be effective, though it probably accounted partly for the unenthusiastic reception his actual cartoons, for example, had in Paris. His imagination was rather heavy, too. The result could be a curious blend of the prosaic and the painterly, as instanced in the Allegory of Time unveiling Truth. There is something ludicrous about Time's would-be flying figure, suspended so awkwardly and with his legs oddly detached. Altogether, as allegory, the composition remains prosaically earthbound	TROY, Jean-François de	An Allegory of Time Unveiling Truth	Oil on canvas	1733	mythological	French	1701-1750

07186-canal303.jpg	The compositions of this work and its companion picture (The Molo: Looking West, in the same collection) complement each other very effectively; they both show dominant buildings in the foreground to one side of the picture, from which the eye meanders both across the painting and into the distance. Their subjects are also complementary; they depict views of the waterfront on either side of the Molo, the seaward part of the Piazzetta. In this painting the view extends from the Doge's Palace right along the quay known as the Riva degli Schiavoni. Boats of all sizes throng the water, and Venetians are shown either in the lofty pursuit of trade and politics (a group of officials energe from the Doge's Palace), or the equally fascinating, although more down to earth business of begging and gossiping. The other painting shows the view from the Column of San Teodoro over towards Santa Maria della Salute on the far side of the Grand Canal.These subjects became extremely popular and were rethought by Canaletto and his studio with small variations for a number of other clients. Canaletto executed related drawings which both he and his assistants could use as a guide when plotting these views	CANALETTO	Riva degli Schiavoni: Looking East	Oil on canvas, 58,4 x 101,6 cm	1730	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

19587-stjerome.jpg	Jan Sanders van Hemessen's religious works are dominated by genre elements. His work therefore represents a significant step in the development of genre painting in its own right. St. Jerome, which originally hung in Rockox's house, is an early work and not entirely typical. In it, he does move away from the traditional rules which artists followed meekly enough in the previous century, and appears to be searching for some kind of originality through exaggeration and ostentation, both in the external appearance of the figure he depicts, and in the emotions he sought to convey	HEMESSEN, Jan Sanders van	St Jerome	Oil on panel, 103 x 81 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
08439-pillow.jpg	"The painting depicts a group of young women in full length, modestly dressed and seated on simple wicker chairs, who are making pillow lace in a bare room without windows or furnishings. The ""sewing school,"" a widespread theme in genre painting of the period, was most likely developed as such by the Danish artist Bernhard Keil (1624-1687), known as Mons&#249; Bernardo, who was active in northern Italy and who repeatedly treated the subject as an allegory of the senses of touch and sight"	CERUTI, Giacomo	Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School)	Oil on canvas, 150 x 200 cm	1720s	genre	Italian	1701-1750
31008-shepher.jpg	The companion piece depicting a Shepherd Boy is also in the Residenzgalerie in Salzburg.Piazzetta's unusual way of depicting the Peasant Girl and the Shepherd Boy is evidenced first of all by his choice of a transverse oval picture format. Only a partial view of the boy is given, and his face, which is aligned slightly rearwards, is partly covered by a large hat. In his frontal view of the sleeping girl, the artist underlined the intimate, lascivious character of the picture by giving her a low-cut dress.The half-length paintings of the girl and boy are modelled on the half-length figures of Caravaggio. The artist was indebted to Crespi for the genre elements and the down-to-earth realism of the depictions as well as for its traditional rustic character	PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista	Peasant Girl	Oil on canvas, 66 x 83 cm	1720-22	genre	Italian	1701-1750
43135-abraham.jpg	For long time it was thought that the painting represents Jacob and Laban. However, in 1987 the subject was identified as Abraham's departure for Canaan, leaving his nephew Lot and his family, who will set off for Sodom. This subject from the Genesis is rarely treated in art	VICTORS, Jan	Abraham's Parting from the Family of Lot	Oil on canvas, 147 x 165 cm	1655-65	religious	Dutch	1651-1700
09663-1stufa1.jpg	"The picture shows a view of the Stanza della Stufa with the Age of Iron (left) and the Age of Gold and Age of Silver (right).Of the numerous apartments in the Palazzo Pitti, two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.In the winter quarters Pietro da Cortona decorated the Stanza della Stufa, and the Rooms of the Planets (Sala di Venere; Sala di Giove; Sala di Marte; Sala di Apollo) between 1637 and 1661.The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641. The iconographic concept is based on Ovid's Metamorphoses"	CORTONA, Pietro da	View of the Stanza della Stufa	Fresco	1637-41	interior	Italian	1601-1650
28657-5cathed2.jpg	When Monet began his serial compositions in the late 1880s, which initially featured haystacks, then polars, and in the early 1890s the cathedral at Rouen, these works constituted a logical progression of his artistic interests. By constantly portraying the same subject, the variables determined by the time of the day and the lighting could be particularly strongly accentuated. Different times of day and a changing colour palette were substituted for innovative subject matter. Monet included the time of the day and the dominant colours in the respective titles of his paintings as a matter of course.Sometimes he worked simultaneously on two canvases, in order to be able to react immediately to changing light conditions. As a result, the subject of the picture receded further and further into the background. At first glance we can see the shape of a cathedral, but on closer inspection the cathedral architecture dissolves before our eyes into a vibrant ensemble, composed merely of a collection of brush strokes	MONET, Claude	Rouen Cathedral in Full Sunlight	Oil on canvas, 107 x 73 cm	1893	landscape	French	1851-1900

07260-canal710.jpg	The painting shows a view of the old Horse Guards and Banqueting Hall, Whitehall, seen from Saint James's Park. It was executed in May or June of 1749, prior to the demolition of the old, red brick Horse Guards building, which began late that same year.This work shows the same subject as the Old Horse Guards from St James's Park in the Tate Gallery, but from a closer and more frontal viewpoint. To the right, behind Old Horse Guards on the far side of Whitehall, is Inigo Jones' Banqueting Hall. Near to it and almost hidden by the screen of trees can be seen part of the Holbein Gate.The painting is related to a working drawing in Canaletto's Accademia sketchbook (Galleria dell'Accademia, Venice)	CANALETTO	View of the Old Horse Guards and Banqueting Hall	Oil on canvas, 47 x 77 cm	1749	landscape	Italian	1701-1750
17142-arles64.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 604, JH 1656.This cheerful still-life was painted shortly after van Gogh left the hospital in Arles which he had entered after his first major attack of psychomotor epilepsy on 25 December 1888. The objects depicted have both an allegorical and a more personal significance. The lighted candle, used in the painting of Gauguin's chair, derives from the emblematic tradition of still-life and signifies light and life; its opposite, the snuffed-out candle, was used in memento mori still-life and van Gogh had included it in a still-life with books which he painted after his father's death in 1885 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh). The optimistic note sounded by the candle flame is underlined by the presence of the sprouting onions, taken from his Yellow Chair (a 'self-portrait'). On the other hand, van Gogh has added his pipe and tobacco and an empty bottle, possibly once containing absinthe, all of which endangered his health.Modern research has intriguingly shown that absinthe itself can cause epileptic fits. Van Gogh had consumed this poisonous beverage in some quantity during the months in Arles, and many of his subsequent fits coincide with occasions on which he had access to it. The drawing board on which most of these objects are placed indicates van Gogh's resumption of work. He informed his brother that he was painting still-lifes to ease himself back into painting after his hospitalization. However, the colours used in this painting are more tempered and less intense, more controlled and less arbitrary than those he had been using both in the summer of 1888 and under the aegis of Gauguin in the autumn preceding his attack	GOGH, Vincent van	Still-Life with Drawing Board and Onions	Oil on canvas, 50 x 64 cm	January 1889, Arles	still-life	Dutch	1851-1900

As a young man he traveled to the north-east of Brazil with Johan Maurits, Count of Nassau-Siegen, who was Governor General of the Dutch colony there. A very few paintings that he made there have come down to us, but the drawings that he must have made there (though very few survive), and above all his own recollections of the seven years he spent there, served as the basis for his entire output over the remaining 35 years of his life	POST, Frans	Brazilian Landscape	Oil on wood, 61 x 91 cm	1650	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

Three tall platforms provide a foundation for the temple, which is depicted as a three-aisle basilica, flanked by loggias.

To the left in the lunette St Stephen is being led to his martyrdom, and to the right we see him being stoned to death. In the lower register Lawrence is first condemned by Emperor Valerian, then in the adjacent scene he is martyred by being roasted on a gridiron.

34360-s_marco.jpg	The painting shows the profile of Venice as it appears from the present-day Giardini when approaching the city by boat from the Lido. To the far left is the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, with the church of the same name and the complex of the Benedictine monastery. Just to the right of the island appear the Magazzini del Sal, dazzlingly illuminated, the Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute on the spit of land known as the Dorsoduro. The Campanile of San Marco looms right on the vertical axis, counterbalancing the predominant horizontals. On the right, the Riva degli Schiavoni stretches beyond the church of the Pieta.The glassy green surface of the water with the dark bank in the foreground, the contrasting light on the various buildings and the snow-white clouds lend the painting an atmosphere all its own. The boat and the shadows in the foreground are motifs which also occur in works of late seventeenth-century Dutch painters of harbour views such as Abraham and Johannes Storck, who may have served Richter as a source of inspiration.Typical of Richter's work are the boats in the foreground painted horizontal to the picture plane. The present canvas occupies a special position among Richter's identified works. He usually worked in the style of Carlevaris, whom he imitated deceptively well. However, in this picture Canaletto's spacious views of the Lagoon were his principal source of inspiration. The remarkable colour combination &#151; green and black &#151; recalls Canaletto's work of the early 1730s. Richter, who died in 1745, must have painted this view of the Bacino toward the end of his career.

18104-2tosse1.jpg	In the centre of the Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse the Madonna breast feeding the Child is depicted. This type of Madonna was common from the late Middle ages onwards. She is surrounded by St Peter with the keys and a book, St Catherine with a broken wheel, St Margaret with a cross, and St Paul with a sword and book. In order to create the impression of a real altarpiece, several angels are holding a curtain around the altar painting. At the bottom edge of the picture, as if placed there quite by chance, Benozzo has painted a small pointed panel painting showing the face of Christ	GOZZOLI, Benozzo	Maria Lactans	Transferred fresco	1484	religious	Italian	1451-1500
38854-bologna1.jpg	The young Pellegrino Tibaldi, who was one of Daniele da Volterra's assistants in Rome, executed two murals in the newly constructed chapel of Cardinal Giovanni Poggi in San Giacomo, Bologna. The chapel, which is dedicated to John the Baptist, has an elaborate system of architectonic articulation. Tibaldi's frescoes (The Sermon of John the Baptist; Annunciation of the Birth of John the Baptist) are restricted to one large field each on the left and right walls. The frescoes are distinguished by unconventional iconography, learned allegory, and newly invented moments in history, that are at the same time commented on by painted manifestations in the heavens.In the left-hand mural John is baptizing and preaching repentance, while angels in heaven are putting devils into chains	TIBALDI, Pellegrino	The Sermon of John the Baptist	Fresco	1551-53	religious	Italian	1551-1600

Wee seem to be looking through the arches of a gigantic loggia into scenes from Enea Silvio's life.

43874-haarlem.jpg	For Weissenbruch and other artists of the Hague School, with their knowledge of Dutch 17th-century art and the Barbizon School, plain air painting became fundamental. Taking Daubigny's floating studio as their model, Weissenbruch and Roelofs regularly went out in boats. Weissenbruch's spacious Dutch scenes, such as View of Haarlem, contrast in their use of bolder and broader brushwork. In their own specific lyrical way, drawing foremost on the colourist juxtaposition of silvery blues and greens with warmer shades, Weissenbruch paintings nicely captured the moist atmosphere that lies upon Dutch landscapes	WEISSENBRUCH, Jan Hendrik	View of Haarlem	Oil on canvas, 72 x 102 cm	-	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
14381-lastjudg.jpg	The Last Judgment by Hieronymus Francken II is the companion piece of the Damned Being Cast into Hell by Frans Francken II. Frans II and Hieronymus II were brothers, they were taught by their uncle Hieronymus I at the same time. This explains the similarity of their hand. Both scenes were based on engravings from a cycle by Hendrik Goltzius.In the Last Judgment most of the figures were taken from Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican	FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, II	The Last Judgment	Oil on oak, 47 x 32 cm	1605-10	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
35516-48mythol.jpg	"The source of the subject is Ovid's Metamorphoses.The love affairs of gods never bode well for mortals; there were times when they caused nothing but suffering even for some of the nymphs. Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard. The inventive god (the Greeks called him ""Hermes dolios"", the schemer) approached the meadows, herding some goats which he had stolen along the way, and played songs on his pipe. The guard was charmed by the new and masterful melodies.Mercury watches intently as Argus is mesmerized by the sound of the flute, and he is already reaching for the weapon with which he will behead the sleepy guardian.Rubens depicted a fipple flute in place of a Pan-pipe. From the aulos used at feasts of Antiquity and the Roman tibia through the medieval bagpipes and Renaissance-Baroque horns and musettes, all the way to the saxophone of our times, every wind instrument was attributed with having a dangerous mesmerizing power"	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Mercury and Argus	Oil on panel, 63 x 87,5 cm	1635-38	mythological	Flemish	1601-1650
29968-winter_n.jpg	The painting depicts a winter landscape with figures on a frozen river, a town beyond. Highlighted near the centre, a group of figures stand in conversation, amongst whom a white horse - a recurring motif in Isaac van Ostade's work - stands with its head bowed.The theme of crowded winter landscapes, pioneered by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, became extremely popular in the seventeenth century. It was one of van Ostade's favourite subjects, and he became one of the genre's finest exponents	OSTADE, Isaack van	Winter Landscape	Oil on panel, 51 x 77 cm	-	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
36455-adoratio.jpg	This is a fine example of Savoldo's mature work. He painted various versions of the same ever-popular subject, but the Brescia painting is the most concentrated and convincing. It reveals Savoldo's appealing poetic sentiment which is demonstrated through the simple and direct gestures of the characters, fully expressing their humanity. The light is subtle and the details build up an impressive feeling of realism. Savoldo's true forte was for night scenes like this, which let him give his liking for unusual light effects full play. Particularly noteworthy is the contrast of the dark background and the brilliantly yet softly illuminated figures in the foreground	SAVOLDO, Giovanni Girolamo	Adoration of the Shepherds	Wood	c. 1540	religious	Italian	1501-1550

He depicts a young dandy with a double-necked lute serenading the unimpressed recipient of his affections in a gated veranda before an urban setting. The painting is obviously replete with references to love and courtship. Playing musical instruments was long considered indispensable to fostering Eros and in this sense, Sorgh's foppish, lute player is entirely conventional.	SORGH, Hendrick Maertensz.

25224-karlstei.jpg	Master Theoderic, a highly original artist, broke free of the styles that were dominated by Italian, Austrian and French art and tried to develop his own distinctive style. Painted between 1360 and 1365, the 30 icon-like portraits of the saints which decorate the Chapel of the Cross at Karlstein Castle are one of the most impressive results of these efforts. The robust features of the individual saints are impressively depicted.Three-dimensional objects have been added, such as carved coats-of-arms, mounted in the manner of collages on the surface of the paintings. Ornamented with discs of gilded Venetian glass and strips of marble encrusted with semiprecious stones, the chapel seems like a Byzantine treasure chamber. It is possible that this room and the adjacent 'privatorium' were intended by the Emperor to create a vision of his future Eastern empire	MASTER THEODERIC	Paintings of Saints	Tempera on wood	1360-65	religious	Bohemian	1351-1400

06109-fugger_c.jpg	"It is presumed that Sebastian Loscher and Hans Burgkmair were jointly responsible for the plans for the Fugger Chapel. The architecture of this family vault for Jakob, Ulrich, and Georg Fugger, which was consecrated in 1518, introduced the vocabulary of the early Italian Renaissance to Germany for the first time. The contemporary furnishings, with sculptures by the Daucher workshop and the painted organ shutters by Jörg Breu the Elder, are important works of the Renaissance, which reached the north of Europe in the early 16th century.The Fuggers were a Swabian merchant and banking family who were also major patrons of the arts, established in Augsburg from 1367. The founder of the Fugger trading house was Jacob I (d. 1469), but the fame and wealth of the family was due to his sons Ulrich (1441-1510), Georg (1453-1506), and Jakob II (""the Rich,"" 1459-1525), founder of the Fugger Chapel in St. Anna's church in Augsburg.

00781-3predel4.jpg	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. In this scene Joseph, the Virgin, the High Priest and St Anne stand in the foreground, a nave of receding columns extending backwards behind them. Exterior space is hinted at by the doorway to the left, the round window in the apse, the edge of the top light high above the nave and the strong light hitting the foreground from a source outside the picture space	ANGELICO, Fra	The Presentation of Christ in the Temple	Tempera on wood, 17 x 26 cm	1433-34	religious	Italian	1401-1450
30425-rocca8.jpg	A small room (the Camerino) in the castle of Fontanellato contains a fascinating fresco decoration by Parmigianino.

13943-venusvul.jpg	In this large, but still sketchlike panel, the goddess of love waits while her husband forges the armour for Achilles's Trojan conquest. The broken-winged, serpent-entwined lance on the ground refers to the caduceus of Mercury, Cupid's father. The free brushwork and breadth of his Italianate pictorialism make Floris parent to generations of Northern artists. All his figures share a painterly freedom and grandeur that proved a harbinger of Rubens	FLORIS, Frans	Venus at Vulcan's Forge	Oil on oak, 150 x 198 cm	1560-64	mythological	Flemish	1551-1600
25901-port_art.jpg	Luis Meléndez trained under his father Francisco Antonio Meléndez (1682-1752), a specialist royal portrait miniaturist, who was instrumental in the encouragement of Philip V to establish an academy of fine arts in Madrid, which he eventually founded in 1744, making the artist an honorary director of painting. Luis Meléndez was one of the first students admitted into the new academy (which was later named the Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1753), where he rapidly excelled in the art of drawing, an event celebrated in his handsome self-portrait (and remarkably the only known portrait by Meléndez) of 1746, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. The highly accomplished skill displayed in this portrait reflects the experience gained by the artist during his apprenticeship to the royal portrait painter Louis-Michel van Loo from 1738 until 1744. The artist holds one of his drawings	MELÉNDEZ, Luis	Portrait of the Artist	Oil on canvas, 100 x 82 cm	1746	portrait	Spanish	1751-1800
05487-2predell.jpg	The picture shows the second predella panel of the St Barnaba Altarpiece.According to a legend, St Augustine the bishop, while he was thinking about the Holy Trinity, met a child on the beach who was attempting to use a spoon to transfer the waters of the ocean into a small hole. When Augustine explained to him that this was not possible, the child replied that it was far more foolish to try to find an explanation for the mystery of the Trinity	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Vision of St Augustine	Tempera on panel, 20 x 38 cm	c. 1488	religious	Italian	1451-1500
35292-festoon.jpg	This painting, formerly attributed to Jan Davidsz. de Heem, contains many elements characteristic of Rotius' master - the flowers in various stages of bloom, the ripe, open pomegranate, and the subtle use of light which renders the flowers and fruits in the utmost three-dimensionality. The blue silk ribbon is also a detail inspired by de Heem's hanging bouquets, and was frequently used by another of his late pupils, Abraham Mignon	ROTIUS, Jacob	Festoon of Fruit and Flowers, with Butterflies and Other Insects	Oil on canvas, 79 x 67 cm	1670s	still-life	Dutch	1651-1700
23294-06lucina.jpg	In this nocturnal portrait the pale moonlight laps the edges of the clouds and just barely mists the shores. Plump and self-confident, the Bergamasque noblewoman stands out with vibrating luminosity against the dark background. In this portrait Lotto mixes various features, namely the sense of belonging to the peaceful life of Bergamo, the ability to depict the sitters extremely vividly and the fondness for plays on words. In fact, the lady's name is concealed in a rebus: in the moon (luna in Italian) on the left the letters CI appear, thus form Lu-ci-na	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Portrait of Lucina Brembati	Oil on panel, 53 x 45 cm	c. 1518	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
17556-14portra.jpg	This portrait shows an unidentified man in middle age. The delicately rendered strands of his graying hair and the salt-and-pepper stubble of his beard, as well as his deeply lined jowls, sagging double chin, and the crow's-feet at the edge of his left eye, are closely observed.This painting was once attributed to Hans Holbein. However, the style and execution are typical of Gossart's, rather than Holbein's works. Such portraits of modest size, tightly cropped, and featuring a plain dark green background were parrt of Gossart's standard output	GOSSART, Jan	Portrait of a Man	Oil on oak panel, 34 x 24 cm	1525-30	portrait	Flemish	1501-1550
30134-company.jpg	This painting depicts a gathering of thirteen expensively dressed young men and women who are enjoying the pleasure of eating, drinking, smoking, and making music in each other's company. As is often the case in Palamedesz's interiors, a group of people is crowded into the right half of the picture, leaving the space at the left almost empty. This imbalance is compensated by placing in the empty corner the figure of the servant boy dressed in red and pouring wine for the merrymakers.This painting is strongly reminiscent of works with similar subject matter by artists active in northern Holland, such as Dirck Hals, Pieter Codde, Willem Duyster, and Hendrick Pot	PALAMEDESZ., Anthonie	Company Dining and Making Music	Oil on panel, 47 x 73 cm	1632	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
44073-3froimo2.jpg	The name of the subject of the portrait was deduced from the grisaille on the reverse side of the panel. The patterned background resembling a hanging is different from the usual neutral backgrounds of Rogier's portraits. In addition, the donor's face seems more softly but less artistically modeled than in those portraits. Since dendrochronology suggests the date of 1469 for the panel showing the donor, the diptych may have been painted by the workshop after Rogier's death	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (right wing)	Oil on oak panel, 49,3 x 31,5 cm	1460s	portrait	Flemish	1401-1450
13414-21paele.jpg	"Here the visual and thematic elements are similar to those of the Chancellor Rolin Madonna. Van Eyck is concerned with showing the presence of a vision and therefore of illustrating the reality of God in our world. Just as Nicolas Rolin is shown in his palace, in the midst of an identifiable environment that seems to make his vision of the Virgin all the more real, so Canon van der Paele is shown in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Donatian in Bruges, where he is being presented to the Virgin by St. George and St. Donatian. Hans Belting is of the opinion that this picture once hung in the choir of the now destroyed church. This would mean that the depicted location mirrored the real location. Van der Paele would therefore have been able to see himself in the very place of his depicted vision and so ""prove"" to the world at large the reality of his divine experience.The exquisite brocades, furs, and silks are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility. On the other hand, the reliefs and sculptures on the capitals in the background and on the Virgin's throne all allude to Christ's salvation of humanity. The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world. Redemption from sin (Cain killing his brother) is possible only through the power of faith (Samson overpowering the lion). The goodness and grace of God ""at the moment of truth"" (Abraham sacrificing Isaac) serves as proof of the redeeming power and presence of servants of God both celestial (St. George) and mortal (Canon van der Paele).This is how van der Paele might have expressed the message of the painting-that paradise was at hand-a message confirmed by its being set in a very real but also sacred context. The Virgin is pictures holding a nosegay and her son a parrot - unmistakable echoes of the Garden of Eden - and both figures have turned to face the meditating canon"	EYCK, Jan van	The Madonna with Canon van der Paele	Oil on wood, 122 x 157 cm	1436	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

23057-40nichol.jpg	The panel (and another also in the Uffizi) came from the church of St Procolo in Florence where it was recorded by Vasari. Presumably it was painted as side wing of a triptych which had a figure of St Nicholas in the central panel (which has disappeared) during the second visit of Ambrogio to Florence between 1327 and 1332, or later. Another possibility is that the panels made up a tabernacle door.The upper scene represents the resurrection of the dead child. In the lower scene Nicholas, as bishop of Myra saves the town from famine by miraculously drying and multiplying the sacks of wheat which had fallen into the sea	LORENZETTI, Ambrogio	Scenes of the Life of St Nicholas	Tempera on wood, 96 x 52,5 cm	c. 1332	religious	Italian	1301-1350
14084-chevalie.jpg	This is the leftt wing of a diptych, originally located in Melun. The right wing showing the Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels is in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp.Estienne Chevalier, who came from Melun, was French Ambassador to England in 1445 and six years later became Treasurer to Charles VII of France. He presented the diptych of which this panel forms the left wing, to his native town; on this wing he had himself painted next to his patron saint, Stephen. The saint, wearing a deacon's robe, is holding a book, on which a jagged stone is lying, as a symbol of his martyrdom. The formal architecture in the background is in the Italian Renaissance style showing pilasters with coloured inlaid marble panels between them. On the wall, receding in perspective, the name Estienne Chevalier is inscribed several times. Originally the donor and the saint were looking towards the Madonna, who occupied the right wing of the diptych; this panel found its way into the Antwerp Museum.According to a description of the paintings by Denis Godefroy in 1661, the original frames were covered in blue velvet. Round each picture were strands of gold and silver thread, in which the donor's initials were woven in pearls. There were also gilded medallions on which stories of the saints were represented.Tradition has it - and there is considerable supporting evidence - that the Madonna's features are those of Agnes Sorel, the beautiful and influential mistress of Charles VII. Known portraits of her certainly do not conflict with this hypothesis. Her relationship with Estienne Chevalier was not entirely political, and an eighteenth-century inscription on the back of the Antwerp panel tells us that the diptych of Melun was endowed by Estienne following a vow he made on her death in 1450. The diptych was in the chancel of the Church of Notre-Dame at Melun, south of Paris, from 1461 until about 1775, when the two halves became separated.The date of Agnes Sorel's death is not the only reason for assuming that the diptych was painted around 1450. At any later period the cut of Estienne's robe would no longer have been in fashion. A few years earlier, between 1443 and 1447, Fouquet had been in Italy and the background of the Berlin panel is clearly the result of what he saw there. After returning from the south, he settled in his birthplace, Tours. From then on he worked for Charles VII and the court and became the leading exponent of the French Court style	FOUQUET, Jean	Melun Diptych: Estienne Chevalier with St Stephen	Wood, 93 x 85 cm	c. 1450	portrait	French	1451-1500
18963-crocett1.jpg	This cupola decoration was painted by Bartolomeo Guidobono and Enrico Haffner in one of the free-standing chapels on the grounds of the Santuario della Misericordia near Savona.

19354-maryscot.jpg	This painting was probably inspired by Sir Walter Scott's The Abbot which vividly depicted the enmity between Mary, Queen of Scots and Margaret Erskine, Lady Lochleven, the mother of James Stuart, Mary's illegitimate half-brother who claimed the throne as Regent during Mary's imprisonment	HAUDEBOURT-LESCOT, Hortense	Mary, Queen of Scots	Watercolour on paper, 41 x 32 cm	-	historical	French	1801-1850
32309-07moses.jpg	This painting, the latest and grandest of Poussin's three versions of the theme, was acquired by the National Gallery jointly with the National Museum of Wales in 1988 and is shown alternately in London and Cardiff. Poussin illustrated events from the life of Moses at least nineteen times. It has been pointed out that when he could, he avoided painting scenes of saintly visions or martyrdoms, the stock-in-trade of seventeenth-century religious art. He concentrated instead on the central themes of Christianity, relating them both to their historical context in the ancient Near East and to the basic tenets of other religions, following an intellectual fashion of the day. Of the Old Testament subjects which he painted, the majority belong to the category of types, or prefigurations, of Salvation.From Early Christian times the Old Testament was read by Christians for its analogies with the New. Thus the waters of the Nile to which the infant Moses is consigned by his mother in 'an ark of bulrushes', following Pharaoh's cruel order to drown all the male Israelite babies (Exodus 1:2), were likened to the waters of baptism. But Poussin's interest in Moses may have been prompted also by his identification with pagan deities; as a contemporary writer influenced by these ideas wrote of this picture: 'He is Moses, the Mosche of the Hebrews, the Pan of the Arcadians, the Priapus of the Hellespont, the Anubis of the Egyptians.'All these ideas reverberate throughout the painting. The baby on whom Pharaoh's daughter has taken pity resembles the Christ Child blessing the Magi or the shepherds in a scene of the Adoration. In the background on the left an Egyptian priest worships the dog-shaped god Anubis (barely visible now that the surface paint has grown thin and transparent). We know we are in Egypt because on the rock above the main scene a river god, symbolising the Nile, embraces a sphinx, palm trees stand on the shore and an obelisk rises up behind a stately temple. (Curiously, the many-windowed buildings with which Poussin, who had never been there, endows Pharaoh's country now resemble modern resort hotels.)The main interest and beauty of the painting, however, do not reside in its possible symbolism, but in the wonderful grouping of the figures, all women to contrast with an analogous group of men in Christ healing the Blind Man (now in the Louvre), painted for the same patron the year before. Each plays her role in the dramatic tale, the princess generous and commanding, the maids curious and delighted. The humbler figure in a white shift at Moses' head may be his sister who watched from nearby to see what would happen to him, and recommended their mother to Pharaoh's daughter as a wet nurse. It is tempting to see their brilliant draperies as a compliment to Poussin's patron, the Lyon silk merchant Reynon. Bodies and colours, each distinct and separate, combine in ample rhythms across the picture surface, echoed by the rocks beyond. It is at once solemn and joyful, as befits a scene in which a child is rescued from death, and through him an entire people is saved.

36856-rhenen.jpg	Hercules Seghers was a gifted contemporary of Rembrandt. His view of Rhenen demonstrates a low horizon and incipient drama that, along with Seghers's unique etching style, were very well known to Rembrandt. Both artists' landscapes seem far more than just what meets the eye, becoming transcendental visions reflecting eternity and mutability alike	SEGHERS, Hercules	View of Rhenen	Oil on oak, 43 x 67 cm	1625-30	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
44473-catherin.jpg	Legend has it that in the reign of the Emperor Maxentius there lived a girl known as Catherine of Alexandria who was as intelligent and wise in debate as she was beautiful to look upon. During the last years of pagan Rome she emerged victorious from every verbal encounter with the Roman sages and it was for this reason that, at the Emperor's order, on the 25th of November, in the year 307 A.D., she was broken on the wheel and then beheaded. Catherine's emblems are therefore the wheel, the sword, the palm-branch and the book, the first two representing her martyrdom, the others her wisdom.Both her life and her death were favourite subjects for paintings in the Middle Ages, chosen even by the greatest artists of the Renaissance when it was only possible to paint a beautiful woman in the guise of a saint. Thus in this painting by Yá&#241;ez we are shown a gentle young girl with a Leonardo-like smile, colourfully dressed and posed against a richly detailed background. Yá&#241;ez was an artist of the Spanish Renaissance who, though influenced by Italian art, retained the vivid colouring and meticulous detail of the Flemish tradition	YÁ?EZ DE LA ALMEDINA, Fernando	Saint Catherine	Oil on canvas, 212 x 112 cm	1505-10	religious	Spanish	1501-1550

38502-andrew.jpg	This painting is above the antechoir passageway in Sant'Andrea della Valle. It belongs to the scenes from the martyrdom of St Andrew painted by Mattia Preti on the choir walls. Originally Preti was also supposed to paint the smaller panels above the passages to the presbytery chapels. Because of a litigation, he never actually did so, and the two panels were ultimately executed by the Albani pupils Carlo Cignani and Emilio Taruffi. The scenes - St Andrew Condemned by Aegeus, and Arrival of the St Andrew Relic in Ancona - produced jointly by the two young Bolognese artists completed the cycle	TARUFFI, Emilio	Arrival of the St Andrew Relic in Ancona	Fresco	1662-65	religious	Italian	1651-1700

25092-joseph.jpg	"Unknown Flemish master, a follower of Rogier van der Weyden. He got his name from the six tondos representing scenes from the Joseph legend of the Old Testament.Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison."

08683-08waterj.jpg	Diderot could have no higher praise of a Chardin still-life than to say: 'C'est la nature m&#234;me.' And for him Chardin remained the great magician-painter whose canvases deceived the eye by their tremendous realism, down to the very textures of the objects painted. Such pictures kept the spectator completely within his own experience, and to some extent that is true of all the pictures painted by Chardin - including those genre scenes which were executed chiefly in the years before Diderot wrote of the Salons, but which are also in their way still-lives. Neither category of picture was novel, and Chardin might seem merely to be practicing what had been among the most typical products of Dutch seventeenth-century painting	CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon	Water Glass and Jug	Oil on canvas, 32,5 x 41 cm	c. 1760	still-life	French	1701-1750

It is situated in the upper row on the left side above the scene of Pilate Washing his Hands.The scene on the Way to Calvary, as Duccio represents it, has the specific purpose of acting as an intermediary between past and future events. On the one hand, the slender, erect figure of Christ, with his hands still tied, refers the onlooker to the various stages of the trial. On the other hand, the direction in which all the characters are moving (to the right, towards the panel with the Crucifixion) and the cross borne by Simon of Cyrene, allude to the terrible conclusion	DUCCIO di Buoninsegna	Way to Calvary (scene 19)	Tempera on wood, 51 x 54 cm	1308-11	religious	Italian	1301-1350

Although it shows reminiscences of Flemish painting, the portrait is more openly ""cavalier,"" with the noble subject posed as if on a stage. The composition plays on the contrast between the closed profile on the right and the open one on the left. The latter relates to the decorative details of the chiseled helmet, the flowers and the feathers, which are all touched by incisive highlights. Notations of light also appear on the lace of the collar and the sleeves, which correspond to the flowers and fruit on the table. Daring contrasts mark the dramatic colour range of blues, reds, and yellows"	FIGINO, Giovanni Ambrogio	Portrait of Lucio Foppa	Panel, 105 x 50 cm	c. 1590	portrait	Italian	1551-1600
12476-05sorrow.jpg	This work depicts Jesus after he had been scourged and mocked by the soldiers, just before he was led away to be crucified. Jesus bleeds profusely from his wounds and he holds the instruments used to beat him, a three-knotted whip and bundle of birches. He wears the crown of thorns, leaning his head on his right hand in a gesture of grief. His other hand rests on a ledge, a pose which Dürer often used to add a sense of depth to a portrait. The face is painted with great realism. Set against a gold background, Christ stares out of the picture, expressing resignation at his fate.This devotional panel was identified as a Dürer in 1941 and although unsigned it is now widely accepted as a work by the young artist. It dates from his journeyman days and may well have been done in Strasbourg, probably in 1493 or early in 1494	DÜRER, Albrecht	Christ as the Man of Sorrows	Oil on panel, 30 x 19 cm	c. 1493	religious	German	1501-1550
04023-1hunyadi.jpg	"The great solemnity of historical paintings was especially apparent in the large pictures by Gyula Benczúr. His master, Piloty, concerned himself with stage-like scenes from the history of Europe, but Benczúr who great up in Kassa in the turmoil of the War of Independence, felt that it was more important to depict Hungarian history. This early work of his, ""László Hunyadi's Farewell"", alredy shows his particular talent for composition, human characterization and realistic rendering. There is deep sorrow on the face of László Hunyadi, the central figure, and one feels his tragic fate looming over the paintful farewell of his friends, Subdued light falls on the group and is reflected from the white walls that are painted with masterly realism.The great succes of this painting marked the beginning of Benczúr's sparkling artistic career. He first exhibited it in Pest in 1867 and then in Paris with the works of eleven other Hungarian painters. In 1869, the Pest Picture Gallery Association bought it for the Hungarian National Museum. It became so popular that the weekly magazine ""Hazánk"" (Our Native Land) reproduced it as a colour supplement in the 1870s"	BENCZÚR, Gyula	László Hunyadi's Farewell	Oil on canvas, 147 x 121 cm	1866	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

13640-17ferenc.jpg	"The laid table with armchairs around it in the garden of the Ferenczy family often appeared in  Ferenczy's pictures (""Sunny Evening"", 1904, ""Sunny Morning"", 1905, and ""The Prodigal Son"", 1908). ""Sunny Morning"", like ""October"", showed an idyllic scene in a little town. Ferenczy views the bright and  peaceful subject not as a humorous one, his considerations as artist make his pictures more than mere genre pictures. The morning sunshine penetrates under the branches of the walnut tree. Eyes are drawn to the table with white table cloth. Shadows of objects (a fruit basket, apples and a blue carafe) are projected on it, together with the delicate shadow of the basket chair which is not in the picture. The natural posture  of people sitting around the table is a part  of  the arrangement. The edge of the table running diagonally is accentuated by the arm and trunk of the female figure who is leaning back in the armchair and by the borderline between light and shadow on the leaves.Ferenczy's composition at this time was characterized by István Réti as follows: ""... he places his figures into narrow space and full figures. It is carefully decided on the basis of proportions and patches how much of them should be portrayed. Proportion of space is shifted towards figures, what does not diminish the importance of  atmospheres in the pictures ..."". The contrast of surfaces in light and shadow is definite. The way he painted the warm colours of faces which are in the shadow of hats is simply superb, just like the grey silk dress. Ferenczy's style of painting is more dynamic and delicate coloured at the same, mow that he gave up his previous plain style"	FERENCZY, Károly	Sunny Morning	Oil on canvas, 92 x 93 cm	1905	landscape	Hungarian	1851-1900

This composition focuses on Christ and St John and confers on them a monumental, classical repose	GREBBER, Pieter de	Baptism of Christ	Oil on canvas, 235 x 155 cm	1625	religious	Dutch	1601-1650
05801-1simon.jpg	Dirk Bouts came from Haarlem, where he doubtless received his early training. Later he settled in the university city of Louvain, where his major work can still be seen in the Church of St Peter. When he was appointed City Painter in 1468, he was already over fifty years old. The Berlin panel, as its close likeness to the work of Aelbert Ouwater suggests, must have been one of his earlier works.The story of Jesus's visit to the house of Simon the Pharisee is told in St Luke's Gospel (vii, 36-50). A woman from the city followed Christ there, 'and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.' Simon condemned the attitude of his guest, saying : 'This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.' Christ answered with a parable and the words: 'Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.'In a narrow, vaulted room, on the left of which is a window providing a glimpse of a landscape, Simon sits with his guests at a table laid for a meal. On the left of the table the sinner bends down to anoint Jesus's feet. The host, the only one present wearing shoes, and Peter beside him, observe the incident with astonishment and disapproval. The youthful John at the head of the table seems to be drawing the attention of the donor, a Dominican monk, to it. The latter kneels with hands raised in prayer and, as if he dare not look, averts his gaze.The arrangement of the figures at a laid table recalls two other themes from the life of Christ, the Last Supper and the Miracle at Emmaus, incidents which were frequently represented in painting and, furthermore, established a pictorial tradition of their own. Here the table is laid with bread, wine and fish, the last of these being an ancient Christian symbol. The composition of the various objects represents one of the most delightful still-lifes in old Netherlandish painting. Among the vessels on the table one can recognize a late medieval form of glass known as a 'cabbage-stalk'	BOUTS, Dieric the Elder	Christ in the House of Simon	Oil on wood, 40,5 x 61 cm	1440s	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

21141-view_squ.jpg	K&#248;bke is one of the most distinguished of the so-called painters of the Danish Golden Age, whose work represents a brilliant contribution to nineteenth- century European art. He started training as an artist at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen in 1822, and from 1828 became a student of C.W. Eckersberg. K&#248;bke usually painted small-scale pictures of great precision - landscapes, studies of architectural subjects and portraits of his family and friends. Whatever the subject, he invariably combined carefully observed, often richly coloured naturalistic details, with a sense of controlled abstract design.This painting was made in about 1830, when he was developing his mature style, and shows the bakery in the Kastel, which is a castle in Copenhagen that served as a prison. The three figures in the foreground are K&#248;bke's father, who owned the bakery, Major J.J. Krohn, and the slave Sergeant Sporch (the prisoners were described as 'slaves'). The scene was one with which K&#248;bke was very familiar as he lived within the castle compound from 1817 to 1834. In the later 1830s his family moved out of Copenhagen and he concentrated on depicting more rural scenes; subsequent visits to Germany and Italy broadened the scope of his subject matter still further	K?BKE, Christen	A View of the Square in the Kastel Looking Towards the Ramparts	Oil on canvas, 30 x 23 cm	c. 1830	landscape	Danish	1801-1850

11149-1870s_14.jpg	From 1870 Degas increasingly painted ballet subjects. In these paintings he explored the subject's potential through variations on the theme. In The Dance Class he has grouped some twenty girls and one or two mothers too, watching or comforting their daughters. Dominating the scene (and painted in as an afterthought) is instructor Jules Perrot, with the huge stick he used to beat out a rhythm. This trial session under the famed teacher is taking place in the rehearsal rooms of the old opera house in Rue Peletier, which has long since burned down	DEGAS, Edgar	The Dance Class	Oil on canvas, 88 x 75 cm	1873-76	other	French	1851-1900
14349-allegory.jpg	Charles V, seated on his throne, is stretching out his hands to his brother Ferdinand, on the left, and his son Philip, on the right. With this gesture of abdication, Germany passed to Ferdinand and Spain and the Netherlands to Philip. The women bearing standards symbolize the Emperor's Dutch, Spanish and Italian possessions. Charles V is depicted as ruler of the world, with women representing Europe, America and India and Neptune the oceans.

12572-6apostl.jpg	Dürer's monogram and the date are visible in the upper part of the two canvases, which are part of a series of twelve heads of apostles which the artist planned, though never completed. The two heads are constructed with an incisive and meticulous line, a reflection of Dürer's troubled search for moral austerity. We may recall that this was a particularly delicate time in German history, shortly before the emergence of Martin Luther and the Reformation.The two saints inspire a diffuse sense of solemn veneration, in the passionate, severe eyes, the embittered curve of the mouths, and the overabundant beards, depicted as heavy, noble masses of coiling hair	DÜRER, Albrecht	The Apostles Philip and James	Tempera on canvas, 45 x 38 and 46 x 37 cm	1516	religious	German	1501-1550
33608-13group.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Sampling Officials of the Drapers' Guild	Oil on canvas, 192 x 279 cm	1662	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
11939-sopron.jpg	"The altarpiece of St. George church in Sopron is one of those rare Baroque compositions which are not a simple devotional picture or a copy of one, but a so-called picture in picture. This type of composition, apart from intensifying the pictorial effect, always refers to some important aspects of the history of devotion of the central picture.In the middle of this altarpieces, in an elegant Louis XIV. style golden frame set out whit laurel festoons and bows of ribbons, is shown the image of the Virgin of Genazzano, at that time famous all over the world, with her special appellation written in a banderole: Maria von guten, Rath, Mother of Good Advice (Aurenhammer 1956. 110-111).The prototype of the Eleousa-type devotional picture was an Albanian Treccento fresco from the church of Skutari, delivered from the Turkish invaders in 1467 the Augustinian hermits in Genazzano near Roma. Its veneration spread by means of copies made for other churches of the order, and won popularity through the pious brotherhoods founded for its honour. The cult of the Mother of Good Advice - obviously because of its anti-Islamic aspects - was encouraged by Pope Innocent XI, so in the 17th and 18th centuries it flourished not only within the order but throughout the whole Catholic Church.In Hungary the altarpieces representing the Mother of Good Advice sometimes also show the angels who, according to the legend, flew with the devotional picture and brought it to its place.The representation of this scene may come from a copperplate of Sebestyén Zeller, an engraver in Pozsony. In Sopron, however, the substitution of this usual environment for an allegorical natural landscape transmits an entirely original, thus far unknown  meaning of the iconography of the picture. The tree struck by lightning and the shattered ancient idol with lire, in his hand had already lost much of their topicallity at the time as symbols for the enemies of the pervious centuries (pagans, Turks, the Reformation). The literary products of the Enlightenment which spread even by way of leaflets, engendered a grave spiritual crisis, disrupting even the traditional unity of the clergy. The verse of psalm written in front of the flashing thunderbolts at the two sides of the picture: Verstummen müssen - falsche Lettzen, Ps. 30. v. 19. (Let the lying lips be put to silence, Psalm 31, 18) gives us a very perceptible rendering of the mood of the belivers confused in their traditional religiosity. With the dark clouds in the background Dorffmaister presents us with a picturesque and inventive representation of the shock that befell the faith before omnipotence of reason, and makes us feel the atmosphere of the crisis caused in many contemporaries by awareness of helplessness.It is in this stormy, almost pre-Romantic landscape in this ""mirror of the soul"" that the gentle look of the Mother of Good Advice and that of the Child on her breast might have been an ""apology"" of orientation and inner satisfaction for everybody having recourse to her"	DORFFMEISTER, István	The Mother of Good Advice	Oil on canvas, 167 x 102 cm	1781	religious	Hungarian	1751-1800
43452-leiden.jpg	In their sheer abundance and variety, Van Vliet's paintings of church interiors create the impression of a commercial enterprise. This was nothing new in the world of Dutch art but it was new to the genre in Delft. Van Vliet's production was consistent and systematic. His constant search for new views in the churches of Delft, his trips to other towns and his use of standard schemes indicate work for the open market.The paintings shows a view of the interior in the Pieterskerk in Leiden from the northern transept to the southwest. This is the earliest known dated architectural painting by Van Vliet.

11662-giustini.jpg	Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicit&#224; Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidotti in 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichino in 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Sala di Diana, Domenichino concentrated his pictures on the ceiling, fitting them into a geometrical system patterned after the Galleria Farnese.

It is precisely in this contained plasticism that we find the result of the integration of the two pictorial cultures. This painting shows a still Giorgionesque atmosphere - the view of the lake and the sunset - in which three superb examples of sculptural nudity are inserted: a doleful Venus, and her attendant maidservants, who turn abruptly to silence a bearded Pan who is continuing to play his flute	SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO	Death of Adonis	Oil on canvas, 189 x 285 cm	1511-12	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

The Palazzo was built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) who was made cardinal by his grandfather Pope Paul III (1468-1549), and named vice chancellor of the Holy Roman Church a year later, according him the highest position after that of the pope in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.The architect of the construction, Giacomo da Vignola, found that the form of the ground plan and the site of the building were dictated by an incomplete fortress begun in the 1530s by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger - a project that had not gone further than the exterior walls on the ground floor. Vignola approached the unfinished structure as a challenge and opportunity to create a unique solution. What was built from 1559 onward had the form of a fortress and the function of a villa, but was in its extravagance an urban palace.The commission for the interior decoration went to Taddeo Zuccaro, who was to make drawings and cartoons for the painting and stucco work but he had to work there only to review from time to time the work that had been carried out there. He largely assigned the execution to others, in particular his brother Federico. After the death of Taddeo Zuccaro in 1566, his younger brother Federico continued the work until 1569. His successor was Jacopo Bertoia, then Giovanni de' Vecchi, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio.The principle according to which the walls and ceilings were painted was retained for all apartments: only in public rooms (halls and their antechambers) were frescoes painted on ceilings and walls, while painting in the private rooms was limited to the vaults, with walls covered in silk, brocade, and similar materials. The themes painted in the ground floor apartments, intended for various uses by guests, are all taken from classical mythology.  The themes of the apartments situated above these on the piano nobile focus decidedly on the master of the house and the function of the individual rooms.In the two rooms on the piano nobile suited for a larger public, the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani and the Sala del Concilio, Taddeo Zuccaro painted a cycle depicting, in a total of twenty-three scenes, the history of the Farnese family	ZUCCARO, Taddeo	General view of the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani	Fresco	1562-63	historical	Italian	1551-1600
39463-03adamev.jpg	This work together with the Creation of Animals and the Murder of Abel, created between 1550 and 1553, was originally in the Scuola della Trinit&#224;.Adam and Eve are depicted not in a landscape thrown into confusion by the hand of the Creator but in a more serene, more human dimension. In the leafy arbour the two nude figures moving around the trunk of the tree form the parallel diagonals of the composition. A strong light gives a sculptural effect to their ivory-pink flesh. But in the background, on the right, the tranquillity of the foreground scene gives way to the tumultuous epilogue to the fact of human disobedience to Divine will. With rapid brushstrokes Tintoretto evokes the fiery angel who drives Adam and Eve out into the distant desolate hills and plains.Eve, temptation personified, is pressing close to the tree of knowledge; her arms prolong the line of the serpent thrusting down from above. Tintoretto confidently shows that he has now perfectly mastered not only the sculptural structure of a muscular, sinewy male body (a particular strength of Florentine painters, especially of Michelangelo) but also the reproduction of female grace and tenderness (the domain of Venetian artists, particularly Titian).The model for Adam is a chiaroscuro woodcut by Antonio da Trento	TINTORETTO	The Temptation of Adam	Oil on canvas, 150 x 220 cm	1551-52	religious	Italian	1551-1600

23262-05head.jpg	A fine youthful work but partially repainted. It was done under the influence of Dürer and Jacopo de' Barbari. It is small, but life-size. Even in this work from his earliest period, the sitter's fully frontal posture is characteristic of Lotto's portraits, and so is the lively sense of personality that emerges from the close-up.In the 18th-century inventories the painting appeared as the portrait of Raphael, executed by Leonardo da Vinci, an assumption based on the soft, atmospheric modeling, the intense psychological penetration, and the traditional iconography of Raphael, who had always been seen as a delicate, elegant and refined youth. Recent X-rays, however, have revealed a previous portrait, completely different the one executed	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Head of a Young Man	Oil on wood, 28 x 23 cm	c. 1505	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

The present painting has been dated to roughly that period, although it is not a documented work and must therefore be considered as attributed to Bijlert.

21468-queen.jpg	Three fancy-dress balls were held at Buckingham Palace by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, each in a different style. At the first on 12 May 1842 the principal figures appeared as Edward III (1312-77) and Queen Philippa (1314?-69). The second, on 6 June 1845, was in early Georgian dress and the third, on 13 June 1851, in the style of the Restoration.Landseer has painted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Throne Room on the occasion of the fancy-dress ball of 1842, standing beneath a specially designed Gothic canopy decorated with purple velvet hangings. Two chairs of state are visible behind the figures and above their heads on the cloth of honour is emblazoned the coat-of-arms of Edward III, combining French and English quarterings. It was from this alcove that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert greeted over 2,000 guests. Members of the Royal Household were expected to appear in costumes dating in style from the reign of Edward III, while the guests were encouraged to wear costumes of any period or country. The setting for the ball and the design of the costumes were entrusted to James Robinson Planche, who was an authority on the history of dress, as evidenced by his encyclopaedic book History of British Costume (1834), as well as a dramatist and a herald in the College of Arms.The costumes worn by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were designed by Vouillon and Laure with the guidance of Planche. For the sake of accuracy reference was made to the relevant monuments in Westminster Abbey. The queen's costume was based upon the effigies of Philippa of Hainault and her daughter Blanche de la Tour (died in infancy 1342), while that for Prince Albert was derived from the effigy of Edward III. Landseer began his painting at the time of the ball, but, as was so often the case with this artist, progress was delayed and the picture was not finished until 1846.

33523-37portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 173.This painting is a record of the meeting between two of the most remarkable figures in Dutch history: the elderly and combative Remonstrant preacher Johannes Wtenbogaert (1557-1644), whose fame must have been at its height at that time, and the up-and-coming Rembrandt van Rijn, who stood on the threshold of celebrity.Wtenbogaert was also portrayed by Michiel Janszoon van Miereveld and Jacob Adriaenszoon Backer.

39256-09george.jpg	St George and the Dragon is a small, even miniature, painting in the context of Tintoretto's work, detailed and highly finished. It was probably commissioned as a private altarpiece, and the conventional arched vertical format had never before, and has rarely since, been used to such dynamic and disturbing effect. The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground. St George has galloped into the painting from our right, the direction of a hidden source of light which picks out the trunks of the trees, the rump of the horse, the armour of the knight and the flesh and garments of Cleodolinda	TINTORETTO	St George and the Dragon	Oil on canvas, 158 x 100 cm	1555-58	religious	Italian	1551-1600
42379-council.jpg	The most famous admiral in Dutch history, Michiel de Ruyter, enjoyed an international reputation and received numerous honours from other countries. De Ruyter was born in Flushing port in 1607, and first went to sea when he was only eleven years old. His navigating skills brought him rapid advancement. De Ruyter was employed by the Admiralty, in Zeeland in 1652 and in Amsterdam a year later. As vice-admiral of the fleet he took part in the numerous sea battles the Dutch fought against England. In 1665 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet. He won a number of victories, but the pinnacle of his career was undoubtedly the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672-1674), in which his superior tactics enabled him to keep a large Anglo-French fleet away from the Dutch coast. De Ruyter was killed at Syracuse in 1676, and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam.This pen drawing by Willem van de Velde depicts the council of war on the eve of the four-day naval battle during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667). The battle, which took place on 11-14 June 1666, was won by the Dutch fleet under De Ruyter's command. The result, however, was disappointing: the English fleet was not destroyed, and losses on the Dutch side were almost as great	VELDE, Willem van de, the Elder	The Council of War on Board 'De Zeven Provincien', the Flagship of Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter, on 10 June 1666	Oil on canvas, 117 x 175 cm	1666	historical	Dutch	1651-1700

04413-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.

43366-sacra_co.jpg	The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date. The panel is signed and dated on the dais of the throne	VIVARINI, Alvise	Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Sacra Conversazione)	Tempera on wood, 175 x 196 cm	1480	religious	Italian	1451-1500
19904-02seymou.jpg	Jane Seymour (1509-1537) was the third wife of King Henry VIII of England and mother of King Edward VI. She succeeded - where Henry's previous wives had failed - in providing a legitimate male heir to the throne.Jane's father was Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, Savernake, Wiltshire. She became a lady in waiting to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then to Anne Boleyn, who married the King in 1533. Henry probably became attracted to Jane in 1535, when he visited her father at Wolf Hall, but, though willing to marry him, she refused to be his mistress. That determination undoubtedly helped bring about Anne Boleyn's downfall and execution (May 19, 1536). On May 30, 1536, Henry and Jane were married privately.During the remaining 17 months of her life Jane managed to restore Mary, Henry's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, to the King's favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and some scholars have interpreted Jane's intercession to mean that she had little sympathy with the English Reformation. The future Edward VI was born on October 12, 1537, but, to Henry's genuine sorrow, Jane died 12 days later.Holbein executed this portrait shortly after the marriage of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. In attitude and expression, the Seymour portrait matches that in the Whitehall composition, but the portraits differ in the arrangement of the bonnet veil; this individual portrait follows the preparatory study in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. This change is important only from a compositional point of view, and probably derived from Holbein himself. However, the major changes in tonality and patterns in Jane's gown will probably have been undertaken only after consultation with the client.Holbein's portrait depicts a figure frozen in an official sense of responsibility. The simplicity of the shadowed background accentuates the increasing richness and boldness of design and adornment in Henrician court fashion, and the artist's skill is pre-eminent in creating the sheen and lustre of the precious stones. Great attention has been paid to the realism of the silver thread in the queen's dress, and this new opulence was to be echoed in the portrait of Henry himself.

07438-certosa.jpg	The exquisite painted decoration of the chapels of the church in the Certosa di San Martino, done both in fresco and in oils, was executed by prominent representatives of the younger Neapolitan school of painting, who were greatly influenced by Caravaggio. Of the works in fresco painting, the most outstanding example is the vault of the San Gennaro chapel, painted by Caracciolo in 1632 with four scenes from the life of the patron saint of Naples. His highly compressed compositions with their wealth of figures and drapery almost threaten to burst through the frames of the relatively small picture panel	CARACCIOLO, Giovanni Battista	Scenes from the Life of St Januarius	Fresco	1632	religious	Italian	1601-1650
07946-rest_f_e.jpg	"During his years in Rome, Annibale was an enthusiastic exponent of a cleansed classical art. He paid tribute to it in the amazing ceiling that he spent the last years of his life painting in the Palazzo Farnese. On this, and also on the large landscape lunettes in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Annibale was helped by young assistants, nearly all from Emilia, who subsequently established the classical style there that proved to be so successful. Annibale Carracci's reputation as an ""academic artist"" and the fact that for over three centuries he has been regarded as a paradigm of classical style, has meant that for too long we have overlooked his no less fascinating handling of nature, evident in his Landscape with the Flight into Egypt. But the melancholy which can be glimpsed in that landscape, whose symmetry almost anticipates Poussin's, overwhelmed Annibale as a man and he stopped painting toward the end of his life. Fortunately, his true place in art has been recognized by recent critical works"	CARRACCI, Annibale	Rest on Flight into Egypt	Oil on canvas, diameter 82,5 cm	c. 1604	religious	Italian	1551-1600
17072-paris22.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 363, JH 1351.The sitter in this portrait was the colour-merchant Tanguy, a Breton peasant who had settled in Paris and ran a small paint shop in the Rue Clauzel, much frequented by vanguard artists. His shop had become a kind of gallery of their paintings, for Tanguy would take paintings on deposit as credit for the painting materials he supplied. Van Gogh painted two portraits of Père Tanguy in the autumn and early winter of 1887, both against a background composed of Japanese colour woodcuts which he had begun to collect, firstly in Antwerp and then more avidly in Paris. Tanguy is placed massively in the centre of the canvas, facing the spectator. But the Paris merchant is presented not against an urban or even French setting, but in an imaginary context composed of Japanese seasonal scenes and costumed figures. Although this choice of background indicates van Gogh's evident preoccupation with Japanese prints - he also made individual copies of selected prints at this date - the painting does not indicate any profound influence of Japanese graphic styles or perspectival devices upon his work. But it is important to note that the motifs represented in the prints anticipate those that van Gogh would shortly resume when he left Paris and moved once again into a more rural setting - seasonal landscapes and portraits of regional types in costume.In his portraits of ordinary people van Gogh emphasized their sadness, dignity and kindness. The Portrait of Père Tanguy is a good example	GOGH, Vincent van	Portrait of P?re Tanguy	Oil on canvas, 92 x 75 cm	Autumn 1887, Paris	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
18320-1208grec.jpg	Painted for the high altar of the Colegio de Do&#241;a Maria, Madrid. The retable no longer exists, and the paintings are dispersed. The subjects of the paintings of the retable are not recorded, but it is assumed that they illustrated the Life of Christ. For reasons of size, style, and subject matter, the following paintings probably came from the retable: the Annunciation, the widest painting, in the centre (the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation); the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ, two paintings of the same size, on the left and right of the Annunciation; the Crucifixion above the Annunciation; and the Resurrection and Pentecost, another pair of identical size, flanking the Crucifixion (the whole forming a retable of a type known in the Escorial). Such an arrangement gives a chronological sequence to the events of the Life of Christ. The payment of 6000 ducados (for the paintings and retable) indicate a large commission. Small versions, probably models, exist for the three paintings more generally accepted as belonging to the retable, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ.Probably originally on the right of the retable of the Colegio de Do&#241;a María, balancing the Adoration of the Shepherds, and painted at the same time. A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome. A later development of this subject, only treated once before, in the Modena Triptych, is the painting for the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, Toledo, probably completed after his death by Jorge Manuel. The pose of the Christ is related to that of the Saint Sebastian of c. 1580. The bipartite composition can be related to the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, the portraits giving place to the range of angels. The splendid ecstatic figure of the angel, between the Baptist and Christ, is one of a number of such symbols that he began to introduce into his painting. If his figures - the actual participants in the action - become increasingly dematerialised, these new symbols appear as emotions materialised in gesture and colour	GRECO, El	The Baptism	Oil on canvas, 350 x 144 cm	1596-1600	religious	Spanish	1551-1600

35488-25mythol.jpg	The story, depicted in the painting is part of the legendary history of Athens and it has echoes of a primitive fertility rite. It tells how Vulcan, in a clumsy attempt to ravish Minerva, accidentally let his semen spill over the ground, and Mother Earth, thus fertilized, gave birth to Erichthonius. Minerva shut the infant in a basket, which she entrusted to the three daughters of Cecrops, king of Attica, forbidding them to open it. But one of them, overcome by curiosity, did so and discovered that the child had a serpent's tail for legs (or that a serpent lay beside it). Maddened with terror the three threw themselves from the top of the Acropolis. Erichthonius, brought up by Minerva, became king of Athens.The three sisters are depicted in the act of opening the basket, out of which a snake uncurls itself. The infant lies inside. Mother Earth is represented by a statue of Diana of Ephesus, the many-breasted goddess of fertility. The theme is most often found in 17th century Netherlandish painting	RUBENS, Peter Paul	The Discovery of the Child Erichthonius	Oil on canvas, 218 x 317 cm	c. 1615	mythological	Flemish	1601-1650

Clarissa is feeding her little dog, but, like Ranuccio, is looking at something taking place outside the picture. This again creates a vivid sense of movement.

08877-0view1.jpg	Most of the frescoes in the transept of the upper church of San Francesco, as well as in the apse, were executed all at once by Cimabue and his workshop. Cimabue, who came from Florence, is the first of the mural painters active in Assisi who can be identified by name. The subject matter of the extensive pictorial program that was executed under Cimabue's direction in the transept and the apse is based for the most part on the dedications of the altars in the western section of the church. A thirteenth-century inscription indicates that the altar in the south transept was dedicated to the archangel Michael; the high altar, to the birth of the Virgin; and the altar in the north transept, to the apostles or to Peter and Paul. Accordingly, the apse had scenes from the life of the Virgin, culminating in the Assumption; the south transept had motifs from the Apocalypse and a large Crucifixion on the east wall; the north transept arm had scenes from the lives of the apostles and another large Crucifixion; and the crossing vault had the evangelists.The scenes from the life of the Virgin in the apse of the Upper Church represent the first large program dedicated to Mary in the history of Italian painting. The paintings of the upper registers are almost entirely destroyed. The four large fields of the basamento to the left and right of the papal throne are dedicated to the death and glorification of the Virgin. The Assembly of the Apostles by the Virgin's Deathbed is followed by the Death of the Virgin and the Assumption. The final painting, shown here, represents the Virgin as intercessor, sitting on the heavenly throne alongside Christ. They are flanked by angels, patriarchs, prophets, saints, and Franciscans.

12384-tobias.jpg	Karel Dujardin's classically styled biblical scenes, produced mostly in his Amsterdam period between 1659 and 1674, betray the influence of the schools of Rome and Bologna in general, and, on occasion, of Annibale Carracci in particular. The Old Testament story of Tobias became popular in seventeenth-century Dutch art, especially in Rembrandt's circle. One of the most commonly treated scenes was that in which the young Tobias, at the behest of his accompanying angel, caught from the River Tigris an enormous fish, whose gall he used to heal his blind father Tobit	DUJARDIN, Karel	Tobias and the Angel with the Fish	Oil on canvas, 85 x 65 cm	1664-65	religious	Dutch	1651-1700

39299-01ceilin.jpg	"This oval painting is part of the ceiling decoration in the Sala dell'Albergo. After his arduous life of wanderings, narrated by the paintings in the neighbouring church, Roch finally reaches heaven, its angelic choirs, and the supreme vision ""face to face.""The spirit of Michelangelo, who had only recently died, seems to permeate this ceiling picture. While the figure of God the Father is reminiscent of the Creator in the frescos of the Sistine Chapel, his encounter with the rising St Roch suggests Titian's famous Assunta, the epoch-making altarpiece of 1516/18 in the nearby Frari church, showing the Assumption of the Virgin. The muscular figure of the saint, patron of the victims of the plague, and the attractive representatives of the nine choirs of angels, slightly reminiscent of Gothic cathedral sculpture, seem to stand on the edge of an opening in the roof itself.

05414-italian.jpg	Jan Both was one of the best known of the Dutch painters living in Italy for varying length of time in the 17th century (the so-called Italianates). They painted landscapes without depicting a specific topography and almost all their works are imaginary compositions. Both's painting - although includes a draughtsman - is no exception. It shows a waterfall and a small gorge overgrown with bushes and trees close to a country road with a bridge which has just been crossed by a travelling party consisting of a carriage drawn by two horses led by grooms. By the side of the road are three groups of two figures each, all wearing rather rustic garbs.Judging by their poses and the sheet of paper held by one of them they are artists surveying the countryside. Opening up on the right is a broad view of the Roman campagna.

But to the modern observer his own description of the picture, written shortly before it was ready for the 1825 Academy exhibition - 'calm &#38; exhilarating, fresh &#38; blowing' - applies more happily to the sketch; the greatest sufferer in the finished canvas is the sky, which has lost its bubbling clouds	CONSTABLE, John	The Leaping Horse	Oil on canvas, 142 x 187 cm	1825	landscape	English	1801-1850

11024-503david.jpg	David's first history painting in exile was an extremely original and disturbing interpretation of the late antique myth of Cupid and Psyche. It was painted for the wealthy Italian patron and connoisseur Count Giovanni Battista Sommariva and, although planned in Paris, it was only finished in Brussels in 1817.As related by the Roman writer Lucius Apuleius in The Golden Ass (late second century AD), Cupid, the god of love, fell in love with the beautiful Psyche and brought her to his palace, where he visited her every night without ever letting her see his face. But curiosity got the better of her, and one night Psyche looked at Cupid while he was asleep. Unfortunately a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp and awakened him, whereupon he abandoned her and the palace disappeared. From then on Psyche was condemned to wander the earth and perform impossible tasks in the vain hope of winning her lover back.Many other artists saw the lovers as innocent, tender and poetic, but David deliberately drew attention to the sexual aspect of the relationship. Normally Cupid was shown as a beautiful young man, but David depicted him as a grinning adolescent who seems proud of his recent conquest. A great contrast is set up between Cupid's coarse ruddy features and awkward angular limbs, and the pale, smooth and languid beauty of the sleeping Psyche. Unusually for David, the colours are bright and intense; in Brussels he looked at the colours used by Flemish Renaissance artists such as Jan van Eyck.

28425-winter_l.jpg	Two out of three winters in Holland during the 17th century saw particularly extended periods of frosts and snow. During the 1660s the level of snowfall increased significantly and two of the harshest winters were in 1662-63 and 1671-72. Dutch artists, among them Jacob van Ruisdael and Klaes Molenaer produced many winter landscape in this period. Molenaer's winter scenes are characterised by a great interest in the harmony and balance between the figures and their surroundings, more akin to the work of the Haarlem painter of the previous generation, Isack van Ostade, than the atmospheric landscapes of Jacob van Ruisdael.The landscape elements in the present scene are broadly repeated in other works by Molenaer.

23686-strambi.jpg	Fra Domenico Strambi was a scholarly Augustinian monk, who was Benozzo Gozzoli's patron when he painted the main choir chapel in Sant'Agostino in San Gimignano. In 1487, Bastiano Mainardi, a native of San Gimignano who was a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, painted on the north wall of the church (to the left  of the choir) a depiction of St Gemignanus seated on his bishop's throne. Three local notables kneel before the city's patron saint. Below this scene there is a painted monument, with an inscription explaining that Strambi is buried here. It shows the deceased laid out atop a sarcophagus in an imaginary niche	MAINARDI, Bastiano	Tomb Monument to Fra Domenico Strambi	Fresco, 250 x 290 cm	1487	religious	Italian	1451-1500
31268-adoratio.jpg	This panel presents a number of compositional and symbolic peculiarities: St Joseph is represented in the background, visible in the middle through the door of the hut, grazing the ox and the donkey, usually depicted next to the Infant Jesus; angels playing long flutes take the place of the shepherds and Magi; the white bird on the beam of the roof (a dove?), perhaps an allusion to the Holy Spirit that descended to Mary. The Virgin's usual blue cloak is adorned with the star of the Byzantine tradition and behind her hangs a humble saddle. The Infant St John has significantly handed the cross, symbol of the Passion, to the child, who, as was common in Tuscan painting, is lying on a sheet and a sack. The figure of the Madonna, like those of the angels, fits in perfectly with the curved edge of the panel, perhaps painted to celebrate a birth, as was customary at the time. Tradition and innovation are fused in this painting, of which there is another version in the Hermitage, considered by some the original and by others a replica of the tondo in the Galleria Borghese	PIERO DI COSIMO	The Adoration of the Christ Child	Oil on wood, diameter 140 cm	1505	religious	Italian	1451-1500

08864-12peter.jpg	"The painting is from the church of Corpus Domini in Venice. It was commissioned by Benedetto Carloni in his woill of November 5, 1504. It is signed in Latin on the paper on the base: ""JOANIS BAPTISTA CIMA / CONEGLIAN(ENS)IS.""Cima must have been attracted at a very early age to Venice, where he was fascinated by the elder Bellini and Antonello da Messina. From them he acquired a pictorial repertory suited to his work on a provincial circuit, and like Montagna and Alvise Vivarini, he propagated their approach to painting on the mainland and in Emilia. His work, however, has richer colour and warmth, through the influence of Giorgione.This altarpiece shows Cima's typical mixture of the archaic and the modern. The impeccably harmonious fifteenth-century construction of architecture and figures is accompanied by a modern sunny atmosphere and a landscape steeped in luminous vapour.

40892-03tripty.jpg	An impression of Ghent panel painting in the shadow of the leading masters is provided by a number of works from religious institutions in the city that have been attributed to local workshops on stylistic grounds. There is, for instance, the Triptych with the Family of St Anne. This work prompted the coinage of the name 'The Master of the Family of St Anne', an anonymous artist to whom several other panels in Ghent have been attributed. The most clearly discernible influence in his work is that of Van der Goes' realism	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Triptych with the Family of St Anne	Oil on panel, 87,4 x 92,5 cm (centre), 87,3 x 37,1 cm (left), 87,4 x 39,2 cm (right)	1490s	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
42811-5braida.jpg	Framed by a concave aedicule with double Corinthian columns, this large painting adorns the high altar of the church, the reconstruction of which materially involved Veronese's patron Michele Sanmicheli in 1552. After the completion of the architecture of the high altar, i.e. soon after 1564, work started on the iconographically unconventional altarpiece under the influence of Tridentine reformist ideas. It omits the gruesome torture of the martyrdom, concentrating instead on the saint's moment of intercession. The central figure is incorporated in a group composition full of movement. The scene of the martyr's unclothing is exaggerated by the presence of the Madonna in a bank of clouds accompanied by Sts Peter, Paul and the cardinal virtues Faith, Hope and Charity	VERONESE, Paolo	Martyrdom of St George	Oil on canvas, 426 x 305 cm	c. 1564	religious	Italian	1551-1600

35717-ruined_c.jpg	Panoramic views of the flat plains in Holland are often said to be the most distinctive contribution of Dutch landscape painting. They differ from the 'world panorama' of earlier Flemish art by seemingly recording the momentary view of a single scene, rather than being composed of a collection of separate visual memories. Formally, they are characterized bb a low horizon line, implying a low viewpoint. Although Ruisdael, perhaps the greatest and the most versatile Dutch landscape specialist, did not invent this type of picture, he became one of its most distinguished practitioners.This painting may represent a view in Gooiland, a district to the east of Amsterdam; there are, however, at least four other, smaller landscapes by Ruisdael that show the same view or part of it with considerable variations, and it is clear that he was not attempting strict topographical accuracy. Despite the pretence of spontaneity, this work, like all landscape paintings of the time, is a synthetic product of the artist's studio.Its dominant feature is the sky, to which two thirds of the picture surface is devoted and which is also reflected in the water of the foreground. This is the real, moisture-laden sky of Holland billowing with clouds, the sun breaking sporadically through scattering shafts of light across the countryside - effects which Constable was later to emulate. Almost more remarkable than the truthful record of the shape, density and illumination of the clouds is the illusion that they are moving through space and over our heads (we tend to think that perspective does not govern cloudscapes, but these seem to taper towards the horizon and broaden at the upper edge of the painting). The long horizon too seems to extend beyond the frame, broken only by church spires and the tiny white sails of a windmill. But our sense of inhabiting the landscape is compromised by our viewpoint in relation to the foreground. By letting us look down into the bastion standing below the horizon line, the painter suggests that we are viewing it from some improbably high place, higher also than the shore on which the peasants graze their flock (both figures and animals were painted by Adriaen van der Velde, a division of labour quite common in Dutch landscapes). This implied detachment, however, strengthens the elegiac mood aroused by the sight of overgrown ruins, melancholy reminders of a distant and more heroic past	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church	Oil on canvas, 109 x 146 cm	1665-72	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

He was buoyed with energy and explored the area for motifs. The present painting was most probably painted among the first group  of works that the painter executed after his arrival. For this painting the artist chose a farmhouse with a thatched roof  and two women working in the garden in front. The thatched roofs reminded van Gogh of his native Brabant	GOGH, Vincent van	Farmhouse with Two Figures	Oil on canvas, 38 x 45 cm	May-June 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

13403-15arnol.jpg	"""The Arnolfini Marriage"" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him"	EYCK, Jan van	Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife	Oil on oak, 82 x 60 cm	1434	portrait	Flemish	1401-1450
40129-aquinas.jpg	The subject of this altarpiece is usually described as the Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas.

20083-11hooch.jpg	This painting, also titled as A Merry Company with Two Men and Two Women, is one of the first genre pictures by De Hooch in which the figures rise above the level of soldiers visiting inns and in which the setting makes tentative claims to gentility. De Hooch took the ideas from Anthonie Palamedesz and Jacob van Velsen in Delft and from many painters in other cities. The Visit  represents the domestication of a social theme that had earlier been set mostly in taverns and bordellos. In slightly later years De Hooch would depict more luxurious rooms and superficially more polite behaviour than he did in this key work of his early maturity	HOOCH, Pieter de	The Visit	Oil on wood, 68 x 58 cm	c. 1657	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
41643-paradise.jpg	This painting is monogrammed B and dated 1576. The anonymous painter is referred to as Monogrammist B of 1576, but he is perhaps identical with Joost de Beer (active 1550, d. before 1595 in Utrecht). He transformed Dürer's famous Adam and Eve engraving into a panel painting. He placed the Fall of Man scene into the centre of a paradise landscape. In the distant background the episode of Creation of Adam can be seen	UNKNOWN MASTER, Netherlandish	Paradise with the Creation of Adam and the Fall of Man	Gum tempera on wood, 70 x 94 cm	1576	religious	Netherlandish	1551-1600
10917-lamentat.jpg	This type of Piet&#224;, whether or not accompanied by other holy women, appears more than once in Gerard David's oeuvre and was adopted on various occasions by painters of his circle such as Adriaan Isenbrant or Ambrosius Benson. A model drawing may have existed in David's studio or perhaps there was another prototype by his hand which is now lost. On closer examination David seems here to have built on both Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling.The composition of the scene is a kind of reprise of Memling's Reins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges). Here too, the scene is set in front of a landscape with on the left buildings intended to represent Jerusalem and on the right a group of rocks which serves as a repoussoir. The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which he placed at Christ's disposal, has been hewn out of the rocks here. Wearing a turban and exotic clothing he stands in profile before the tombstone, while Nicodemus enters the tomb. With Memling it is a Roman sarcophagus which stands in front of the rock and which is being opened by Joseph and Nicodemus. The composition itself, with the body held almost upright under the armpits and the head nodding to one side, derives from the right wing of Hugo van der Goes' Lamentation diptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The figure of the Virgin placed parallel along Christ's body with her arm diagonally across it is an adaptation in reverse of the Virgin's posture in Van der Goes. The same is probably also the case with the position of the squatting Mary Magdalene. The St John, with his right knee and foot in frontal view, is also borrowed from Memling's Reins triptych. The spire in the landscape is probably intended to suggest Bruges' Our Lady's Church	DAVID, Gerard	Lamentation	Oil on oak panel, 39,4 x 31,7 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
07663-carlev08.jpg	The painting affords a view of the Serenissima's most characteristic quay: the Molo, with the columns of San Marco and San Todaro (or Teodoro) framing the entrance to the city. On the left stands the Ducal Palace, rendered in minute detail. The steep perspective in which the building is captured continues into the background along the Riva degli Schiavoni. Cast in contrasting light and truncated by the upper border of the image, the column of San Todaro dominates the scene. Between it and the column of San Marco the mast of a schooner appears in the background; it marks the central axis of the composition. Together with the large schooner on the right, the column of San Todaro to some extent counterbalances the buildings which occupy the left side. There is much activity both on the water and in the Square, where most of the figures are gathered in small groups.This view of the Molo and the Ducal Palace towards the east is highly unusual. Instead of depicting the Palace frontally, Carlevaris turned a quarter circle so that we look down the façade of the building towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a composition he also used in four later works. The vantage-point in all these works is from the loggia of the Library, directly opposite the Ducal Palace.Although the architecture dominates the composition, the artist paid close attention to the human figures. Drawn or painted studies for several of the macchiette have survived. Scenes of people and situations drawn from everyday life were introduced to Italy in the first half of the seventeenth century by Dutch painters active in Rome. In the course of the century the so-called Bamboccianti cast such everyday scenes with growing frequency against a &#151; sometimes identifiable &#151; urban background. One of these painters was Johannes Lingelbach, whose work seems to have inspired Carlevaris's vedute. The Venetian artist is thought to have spent some time in Rome, where he could have become familiar with Lingelbach's work.Carlevaris's town views are also deeply rooted in the Venetian tradition of depicting historic or festive events. His View of the Molo with the Ducal Palace, however, does not document a procession, reception or other festivity; rather, it subordinates the human figures to a portrayal of one part of the city in meticulous, topographically correct detail from an unorthodox point of view	CARLEVARIS, Luca	The Molo with the Ducal Palace	Oil on canvas, 70 x 118 cm	c. 1710	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

22145-ludovisi.jpg	This sensitive portrait of Ludovico, turning his head to meet the gaze of the viewer, must have been painted by Ottavio Leoni shortly after Ludovico, a protégé of Pope Gregory XV (1621-1623), became cardinal. Wearing the ring symbolic of his new office, his lively right hand grasps the chair, while his left hand languidly holds a letter, likely alluding to Ludovico's duties as secretary of state. In the seated, three-quarter length format the influence of Raphael can be noted	LEONI, Ottavio	Portrait of Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi	Oil on canvas, 136 x 100 cm	1621	portrait	Italian	1601-1650
34032-2renoi13.jpg	This picture is one of Renoir's largest composition. It features the cheerful attitude to life and the Impressionist theme of figures in the open air.

43965-2tripti1.jpg	"The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier. Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck. It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier. Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background. This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or ""Chinese apple"", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors. Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the ""devotio moderna"". This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life. In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him. This is why the angel Gabriel appears before Mary dressed in an immaculate alb and magnificent brocade cope, as if he had come to celebrate mass, rather than deliver a message"	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	The Annunciation	Oil on oak panel, 86 x 93 cm	c. 1440	religious	Flemish	1401-1450
21261-port_man.jpg	This small double-sided panel bears a portrait of a man on one side and a depiction of a girl making a garland on the reverse. The identity of the young man is not known.

35820-ferrybo.jpg	With far-reaching stylistic similarities in their monochromatic, tonal treatment of the subject, Salomon van Ruysdael's river landscapes and those of Jan van Goyen from the 1630s are almost indistinguishable. However, around 1645 the first-named artist discovered the pictorial possibilities of the tree motif in compositions, through the work of his much more famous nephew Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael, in which this element plays a key role. This gave his variations on the theme a new impulse, and between 1645 and 1655 he painted a series of peaceful, limpid views with which he reached the summit of his art. With the cautious expansion of his palette and the more self confident style typical of these years, his work is also much more distinctively his own.The compositional structure to which this landscape owes its attractiveness is of a bold simplicity. A quarter of the way up the picture the horizontal axis intersects a vertical axis provided by the dark silhouette of a group of trees rising up on the opposite river bank. This divides the picture into two zones, of almost identical size, but in formal contrast to each other. In the left half each individual motif, under a highly atmospheric sky, bathes in an aura of lightness and weightlessness, contrasting with the right half, where mass and volume are piled up in the form of a farmstead, overshadowed by the tree group. Within this constellation even the ferry in the left foreground, laden low with a four-in-hand and a large number of passengers, appears like a fallen leaf carried along effortlessly by the river, the connecting feature stretching through this landscape.Within Salomon van Ruysdael's work, catalogued by Wolfgang Stechow, this painting represents an exception from his otherwise typical use of diagonals in his compositions. But whenever in later works he returns to this traditional pattern, this Ferryboat appears to have been a key work for the discovery of new waterside motifs, providing the viewer with variety and entertainment during his visual walk along never-ending river banks	RUYSDAEL, Salomon van	The Ferryboat	Oil on canvas, 91 x 130,5 cm	1647	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
27081-oyster_e.jpg	Mieris's work are marked by the exceptional thoroughness of details, an effective variety of textures, and a smooth manner of painting akin to that of enamel miniatures. The everyday subject has an obvious erotic subtext: the richly furnished interior and elegant attire mask the vice that is cultivated in this establishment dedicated to gratification. The gentleman offers oysters, a symbol of lust and base pleasures.

05008-findmose.jpg	This painting and The Feast of Dives (Accademia, Venice) are considered Bonifacio's masterpieces. He has used the subject as an excuse to paint an open-air holiday scene, in which the luxuriousness of the clothes melts into the opulent landscape dotted with little genre scenes. In overall decorative effect, the painting is much like a tapestry. Bonifacio's sources of inspiration include Titian and Dosso, with some influence from northern European painters.

44680-tribuna.jpg	The painting has become one of the most celebrated images of eighteenth-century taste. Zoffany shows a group of connoisseurs and members of the nobility admiring works of art in the Tribuna, the principal room of the Uffizi in Florence, which was the most famous gallery in the world during the eighteenth century. The Tribuna had been built by Francesco de' Medici in 1585-9 to a design by Bernardo Buontalenti as a showcase for the most precious items in the Medici collection. Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale. In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture. The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor. The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772. Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray. Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael. For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion. The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici. These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene. In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force. The attention to detail and texture involves not just the portraits, but also the copies after the works of art nearly all of which are identifiable. Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.

33455-19oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 521.The story of David and Bathsheba is in the Bible (II Sam. 11 :2-17). One evening while he walked on the roof of his palace David saw below him a beautiful woman bathing. This was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite who was then away on service in David's army. In an act of seignorial arrogance he had her brought to the palace and made love to her. She became pregnant as a consequence. Later he wrote to Uriah's army commander saying, 'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle . . . that he may be smitten and die.' This indeed came about and David afterwards married Bathsheba. The child survived only a few days. David subsequently did penance.Bathsheba is usually depicted at her toilet in various states of nudity. Earlier Renaissance artists show her clothed and merely washing her hands or feet, helped by attendants. Sometimes a messenger is shown arriving with a letter, though the Bible does not record this detail. David's morally indefensible conduct did not deter the medieval Church from drawing a typological parallel: he prefigured Christ and Bathsheba the Church.Rembrandt's painting shows Bathsheba as she receives the message of King David summoning her.

39243-02creati.jpg	One of the major achievements of Tintoretto's early works is the series of canvases painted in about 1550 for the Sala dell'Albergo of the Scuola della Santissima Trinitá. And of these the Creation of the animals is certainly unique for the swirling rhythm of the composition. In a blaze of golden light, which does not entirely escape the darkness still partly enveloping the newly created earth God the Father is portrayed as if suspended in mid-air in the act of creation. The animals rush forward from behind him while the birds shoot across the sky and the fishes dart through the water like arrows from his hand. The dramatic wind-swept scene is furrowed by the profiles of the animals which cross the canvas in running lines, conveying with extraordinary concision and expressiveness the theme of the work.Like Pietro Aretino's novel on the subject of Genesis, Tintoretto's painting shows the unicorn (right). The alleged curative and decontaminating qualities of the narwhal tusk, an essential item in every Renaissance cabinet of curiosities, were regarded as proof of the existence of this fabulous creature. Exotic creatures like the ostrich walking on the shore were much admired as gifts from guests to the princely courts of northern Italy, and were portrayed in drawings or engravings. As a true Venetian, however, Tintoretto here devotes particular artistic skill to the fishes, including sturgeon, salmon and red mullet.Tintoretto's model for this composition was Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery, London); he adopted the flying divine figure as well as the setting.

35698-water_m.jpg	Besides the Bentheim Castle, another motif Ruisdael discovered on his trip to the Dutch-German border region was the water mill. The half-timbered overshot and undershot mills he favoured were found in the eastern provinces of the Netherlands and in the area near Bentheim. Of course, earlier artists included watermills in their pictures but he was the first to make them the principal theme of a painting. The subject became one of the specialities of his pupil Meindert Hobbema, and today, when we think of them, his paintings not Ruisdael's come to mind. But in judging their respective accomplishments it is helpful to recall that Ruisdael painted powerful ones, such as Two Water Mills and an Open Sluice, which impresses by the cohesion of its forms and clear daylight effect, before Hobbema held a brush in his hand	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Two Watermills and an Open Sluice	Oil on canvas	1653	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
44046-1diptych.jpg	The two small panels, representing the Madonna and St Catherine of Alexandria, respectively, probably formed a diptych.The busts of prophets on the outside of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck were the model for the bust of God the Father at the top of the left panel. The figures of Adam and Eve were from the same source. The picture is usually regarded as an early work by Rogier himself from the years 1432-35, but the figure of the Madonna is probably after Jan van Eyck's Madonna of the Fountain, dated 1439, in Antwerp.The right panel is rather weaker, and is not by the same painter as the Madonna. As a king's daughter, Catherine has a crown, but she has taken it off, perhaps a sign of humility and reverence before the Madonna, and has placed it on the ground to lie there ignored. The wheel, her attribute, refers to the failure of the attempt to break her on the wheel; the martyr was finally beheaded with a sword	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Diptych	Oil on oak panel, 18,5 x 12 cm (each)	c. 1440	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

31738-01figure.jpg	Pissarro's landscapes include the people who live and work there; unlike his Impressionist friends Monet and Renoir, these are not city people who travel to the country to relax on the weekend, but peasant farmers and their wives, herdsmen, and shepherdesses. Yet, unlike Millet, Pissarro does not monumentalise his agricultural labourers.

19686-westerke.jpg	The works of Jan van der Heyden, one of the finest city-view specialists, are responsible for our general impressions of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite.Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building.Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal	HEYDEN, Jan van der	View of the Westerkerk, Amsterdam	Oil on panel, 41 x 59 cm	1670s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
03766-031madon.jpg	"Of all the still youthful Madonnas by Bellini the masterpiece is the so called Greek Madonna of the Brera Gallery in Milan, which entered the Museum in 1808 following the Napoleonic repression. It was originally in the Ducal Palace in Venice. According to some sources the figures were originally set against a gold background, on which the words ""Mother of God"" and ""Christ"" were written in Greek (hence the name of the painting). Obviously, a background of this type would have made it archaic and ""archaizing"", considerably accentuating the Byzantine appearance of the panel, a veritable Marian icon. The 1986 restoration has established that the still remaining traces of gold beside the Greek letters were a 16th-century addition, while Bellini had originally conceived the sky as it appears now: blue and almost entirely covered by a small curtain held up by a cord. Over the traditional preparatory ground (gypsum and animal glue) he had sketched out the preliminary drawing, marking in with extreme precision even the chiaroscuro with subtle and highly regular criss-cross strokes which can be seen in infra-red photography. This technique used by Bellini must have been famous if Paolo Pino in his Dialogo di pittura (1548) writes that ""drawing the painting with such extreme diligence, composing it with chiaro and scuro as Giovanni Bellino was wont to do"" was to be discouraged ""for it is work thrown away since everything must be covered with the colours"".This type of drawing shows similarities with the rigorous Flemish constructive technique, though under closer scrutiny it appears to be aimed at a search for a much more solid and volumetrically constructed plastic quality. The delicate imperturbability of the Madonna, which would always remain a distinctive feature of Bellini's Virgins, shows not only its aforementioned Byzantine-iconic roots, but also how much the artist's culture owes to this heritage"	BELLINI, Giovanni	Madonna with the Child (Greek Madonna)	Tempera on wood, 82 x 62 cm	1460-64	religious	Italian	1451-1500
38722-unequal.jpg	This painting, which was altered by the artist and later cropped at the corners, depicts an almost claustrophobic interior, featuring a bare-chested prostitute clutching the fur garment of a man wearing a mask and pince-nez, both of which make him appear much older than he actually is.

09530-selfport.jpg	Occasionally a painting contains extra information, about the scene itself, for example, or about the artist. This self-portrait by the Amsterdam painter Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen tells us important facts about his life. The note with the date 1533 and the house mark between an I and an A appear to announce that Iacobus Amstelodamensis, or Jacob of Amsterdam, painted this portrait of himself in 1533. It is known from the archives that Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, the person behind the name Jacob of Amsterdam, must have died before 18 October 1533, the date of a document stating that his wife was a widow. That and the date on the Self-Portrait appear to be conclusive evidence that the artist did indeed die that year.However, it has been suggested that he was dead by 1532, when one of his houses was sold. So 1533 or 1532 - it is not known for sure. On top of that, there are doubts about when the Self-portrait was actually executed. It is very close in style to the paintings that Jacob Cornelisz made around 1525, and he is not known to have made any more after 1526. It is possible that the date was added later, in the year of his death, and that we are looking at a Van Oostsanen who is younger than he appeared in 1533.There is another panel in which the same man is seated before an easel, painting the portrait of an older woman. It is by Dirck Jacobsz, the couple's son, who traced the head in the Rijksmuseum Self-Portrait and used it for the man by the easel. He then added his mother's likeness, creating an anachronistic scene: a portrait of his father as he probably looked before 1533, and one of his mother as she appeared around 1550	CORNELISZ VAN OOSTSANEN, Jacob	Self-Portrait	Oil on panel, 38 x 30 cm	1533	portrait	Netherlandish	1501-1550

07264-canal714.jpg	The Royal Hospital at Greenwich was completed in 1752, over half a century after it was begun. Canaletto painted this depiction of it soon afterwards. It shows the view, which has altered little, through the centre of the hospital complex to the Queen's House, and on towards the Royal Observatory at the top of the hill beyond.Canaletto has created a slightly 'wide angle' effect by combining what can be seen of the hospital from two separate viewpoints which are set a little way apart on the near side of the Thames. He has slightly broken the potential symmetry of the composition by studying the buildings from a little left of centre. In addition, the monotony of the river is relieved by the considerable variety of craft that is travelling up and down it, and also by the unrelenting verticals and horizontals of the design which are countered by the bold diagonal of the mast of the ship grounded at the right.The river and architecture were established first by the artist, and the boats then painted over the top; it is just possible to see the buildings through the sails of the boat to the left of the centre of the picture	CANALETTO	London: Greenwich Hospital from the North Bank of the Thames	Oil on canvas, 66 x 112,5 cm	c. 1753	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

43703-selfport.jpg	This self-portrait shows the artist sitting at his easel pointing to a painting that he has just completed. The painting of the nude on his easel is probably a representation of 'sight' from the traditional series of the five senses, explaining the little hand-mirror - and, of course, the unseen mirror into which Waitt himself looks.

28483-winter_l.jpg	Momper is rightly regarded as the most important Flemish landscape painter between Pieter Brueghel and Rubens. Brueghel's influence is clearly evident in this winter landscape, and it is quite probable that his son Jan also painted a number of the figures in this picture.Momper's personal achievement lies in his rendering of landscape as a picturesque subject matter in its own right. What we see here is no longer a great universal landscape full of symbolically charged allusions, but a scene whose aesthetic appeal is valued for its own sake. Momper's painting is divided into various planes by a kind of backdrop, against which silhouettes are highlighted by a pale light or dark, thundery clouds. People are making their way along tortuous paths on terrain that seems to be hazardous.Rain-laden stormclouds, sunshine and snow set the atmosphere of the painting. In this respect, Momper has taken an important step towards emancipating the landscape painting as an autonomous genre in which the landscape is not merely a setting for some event, but is treated as a subject matter in its own right	MOMPER, Joos de	Winter landscape	Oil on panel, 49,5 x 82,5 cm	c. 1620	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650

13439-alfieri.jpg	"Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803)was an Italian tragic poet whose predominant theme was the overthrow of tyranny.To glorify the personality of this writer of tragedies, Fabre has clearly added to the faithfulness of the portrait a heroic tone, evident in the facial expression and the pose of the raised arm over which the brown mantle is slung all'antica.Beyond its value as a historical document, the work is also a striking example of the more severely classicistic current which emerged from the school of David, of whom Fabre was a pupil and close follower.The painting is signed and dated in the lower right corner, ""F.

24243-view2.jpg	The painting represents a capriccio of an imagined cityscape with Saint Mark's Basilica and ruins on the banks of a river. This imagined riverside town is typical of the spirited and picturesque landscapes created early in the career of Michele Marieschi. The artist includes celebrated and instantly recognizable edifices, such as Venice's Saint Mark's Basilica here, and places them side by side with fantasy buildings and crumbling ruins.  The artist is not bound by rules of perspective: the ruined columns and the tower overgrown with greenery are painted to a completely different scale than the houses directly opposite them on the other side of the river at right. They dwarf the figures beneath them, who cross the bridge between the two sides	MARIESCHI, Michele	Capriccio of a Riverside Town	Oil on canvas, 51 x 75 cm	c. 1735	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

02892-il_gesu2.jpg	The picture shows the cupola, pendentives, transept vault, and antechoir of the church of Il Ges&#249; in Rome.In Baroque churches, in addition to the choir, the nave vaults, transept chapels, and cupola (if present) offered large and attractive surfaces for painting. Although fictive openings in ceilings and vaults had already been created in painting in the sixteenth century, permitting vivid views of events taking place in heaven, the heavenly visions of the seventeenth century take on a new quality, scale, and intensity. The supreme example is the ceiling composition executed by Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Il Ges&#249;, the most spectacular of a fresco program encompassing virtually the entire church that Baciccio worked on for thirteen years (1672-85). In earlier examples the architecture served as the framing for the pictures, in Il Ges&#249; the relationship between architecture and painting was redefined: painting and decoration are confined to those portions of the church structure of greatest symbolic importance	BACICCIO	Cupola decoration	Fresco	1676-79	religious	Italian	1651-1700

These window framings, with their nude youths atop festoons of fruit, are primarily decorative displays of artistic virtuosity; at the same time they contain elements - for example the tondo with the chiaroscuro depiction of Time revealing Truth - that can likewise easily be seen as referring to the theological content of the frescoes as well as to the work of the confraternity	SALVIATI, Cecchino del	Illusionistic window	Fresco	1536-53	religious	Italian	1501-1550

While this composition was openly derived from classical art, it was meant in the spirit of purest love and has a genuine if rather insipid beauty.Though a ceiling decoration, it is composed in the form of a frieze as if painted on a wall.

37933-celtwin.jpg	Even the ritual of the lying-in visit, associated with childbirth, was not spared Steen's parodying brush. In the Twin Birth Celebration he depicts a hilarious and witty scene of a flustered elderly father who is mocked by a throng of clamorous women as he receives his newborn twins. Steen's old man must be impotent &#151; since common wisdom held that the aged were infertile &#151; and therefore completely incapable of having sired one infant, let alone two. A younger, virile man must have fathered them as the old fool, much to his consternation, has suddenly realized	STEEN, Jan	Twin Birth Celebration	Oil on canvas, 69 x 79 cm	1668	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

26380-puddlers.jpg	Meunier found his main subject in about 1880: man at work. from 1885, he also turned to this particular subject in his sculpting. The title of this relief is a reference to the puddling and Krupp burning process used in iron-making. Only a small area of the blast furnace, the actual place of work, is shown on the right-hand edge of this relief. The middle one of the three labourers is one of the most impressive to be seen in any of Meunier's works. His right foot is pressed against the furnace, his torso is stretching backwards. Every muscle, every sinew is tensed as he works the iron with all his strength.Meunier's labourers are types rather than individual people and are idealised.

39286-1mark.jpg	The painting is the first of a series of works, painted in 1548 for the Scuola Grande di San Marco while Marco Episcopi, his future father-in-law was Grand Guardian of the School.The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearence of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of the saint against his master's will. The scenes takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light, while the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.In keeping with the drama of the action is the tight construction of the painting, the dramatic fore-shortening of the forms and sudden strong contrast of light and shade	TINTORETTO	The Miracle of St Mark Freeing the Slave	Oil on canvas, 415 x 541 cm	1548	religious	Italian	1551-1600

The eagle which is to devour his liver every day - Prometheus' punishment for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mankind - is hovering ominously in a corner. In this mythological scene, Van Baburen shows himself to be a true Caravaggist, with contrasts of light and shade, dramatic expressions and unidealized people with sun-tanned hands and faces.

She is worshipped by Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who appear on a smaller scale at the sides of the throne. The former, wearing the Dominican habit, holds a lily in one hand, and in the other the book of the Constitutions of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans); the latter, recognizable by her attribute, the wheel, holds the martyr's palm between her hands. The holy child, standing on his mother's lap, strokes her cheek with his right hand while she holds him close, and in her free hand she holds a white rose.The early provenance of the panel is not known	ANGELICO, Fra	Virgin and Child with Sts Dominic and Catherine of Alexandria	Tempera with gilding on wood, 24 x 19 cm	c. 1435	religious	Italian	1401-1450

The young man, who is looking very slightly down towards the observer, is wearing a red jerkin and the characteristic headgear of the Florentine Quattrocento, the mazzocchio. The hat band which is casually draped across his shoulder provides an artistic frame for the young man's face.The sitter of the portrait is probably Gianlorenzo de' Medici, and it could very well be Botticelli's first commissioned work, and from the hair and the clothes, the portrait must date from no later than 1469	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Portrait of a Young Man	Tempera on panel, 51 x 33,7 cm	c. 1469	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

35734-water_fx.jpg	Ruisdael never visited Scandinavia, but he borrowed the idea of Norwegian landscapes from Allaert van Everdingen, an artist who worked for a time in Haarlem and had success with such works. A rush of water carrying away a broken tree, a house huddled on a slope, and tiny figures beneath a clouded sky - all these components make it possible to see the painting as a piece of 17th-century speculation on the romantic opposition of man and the elements	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Waterfall in Norway	Oil on canvas, 108 x 143 cm	1668-72	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

07527-28ceras.jpg	The Crucifixion of St Peter in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo is one of two paintings in the Cerasi Chapel. Three shady characters, their faces hidden or turned away, are pulling, dragging and pushing the cross to which Peter has been nailed by the feet with his head down.Caravaggio's St Peter is not a heroic martyr, nor a Herculean hero in the manner of Michelangelo, but an old man suffering pain and in fear of death. The scene, set on some stony field, is grim. The dark, impenetrable background draws the spectator's gaze back again to the sharply illuminated figures who remind us, through the banal ugliness of their actions and movements - note the yellow rear and filthy feet of the lower figure - that the death of the apostle was not a heroic drama, but a wretched and humiliating execution	CARAVAGGIO	The Crucifixion of Saint Peter	Oil on canvas, 230 x 175 cm	1600-01	religious	Italian	1551-1600

14668-2refecto.jpg	Taddeo Gaddi was Giotto's most important student, belonging to his workshop for twenty-four years. He produced a number of frescoes in Florence and Pisa, besides numerous panel paintings, but until his death in 1366 he was mainly active in Santa Croce, the Franciscan monastery in Florence, and his house and workshop were nearby. His late works, from around 1360, include the fresco of the Crucifixion in the sacristy and the ensemble of paintings grouped around a Tree of Life (Arbor vitae) in the refectory of Santa Croce.The picture shows the interior of the refectory in Santa Croce in Florence. The frescoes were commissioned by the woman in the garments of a Franciscan tertiary kneeling at the foot of the cross, behind St Francis.

38750-colbert1.jpg	In the second half of the 17th century all of Europe admired - though no one really imitated - France's various academies: art (established in 1648), science (1666) and architecture (1671). These academies were not only repositories of knowledge, they also backed extensive operations such as factories (tapestries, mirrors)and specialized workshops directed by superintendents and their agents. Never had artistic life been organized so thoroughly, so precisely, so extensively.

26719-lu10rob.jpg	"""Solomon begat Rehoboam. Rehoboam begat Abijah. Abijah begat Asa.""

This is a detail that is only found here, and it may be compared to the low step on which, on the other side of the lunette, the sleeping young man rests a foot. The woman's right arm and hand are stretched out on her leg, while her left hand points to the unborn child she is carrying in her womb.The young man at right is seated bent forward in an attitude of complete abandon. His head, with his face turned toward the wall, is resting on the hand placed on his right knee; his other arm hangs down at his side. Behind him, a young boy seems to be trying to make him sit upright by grabbing his shoulder.

26062-17rein.jpg	This small triptych is the second altarpiece to be commissioned from Memling by a brother at St John's Hospital in Bruges, the first being the Floreins triptych. The donor has been identified as Adriaan Reins on the basis of the initials AR on the frame and the figure of St Adrian who protects him in the left wing. Reins was received into the Order in 1479, and died in 1490.The principal scene is a Lamentation on Golgotha beneath a glowering evening sky. The left wing represents the donor with his patron saint, while the right wing features St Barbara, the hospital saint par excellence.The composition is a development on an idea of Rogier van der Weyden, who was the first to reduce the Lamentation to its three principal protagonists (apart from Christ) in a number of smaller compositions. The body with its stiff, open arms and closed legs, knelt over by the praying Virgin, first appears in another work by the same master, namely the Lamentation in The Hague (Mauritshuis). The scene as a whole is portrayed in deep and sombre tones. The predominance of purple - including the marbling of the frame - means that the altarpiece is literally enveloped in the colour of the Passion.Two versions of this Lamentation are known: the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych in Rotterdam and the Rome Lamentation, both of which were probably painted at an earlier date. The former in particular may be seen as the immediate compositional predecessor of the Reins triptych.Doubts as to the authorship of the work were expressed from an early stage, probably because the figures of St John and Mary Magdalene did not meet the idealised Memling image that had been formed by the nineteenth century, and because of the lack of an inscription with the artist's signature. Despite these doubts, this little triptych is a masterpiece, executed with the utmost delicacy.The central panel was partially copied (landscape, Christ and St John) in the Santa Barbara Lamentation by a follower of Memling from the late fifteenth century	MEMLING, Hans	Triptych of Adriaan Reins	Oil on oak panel, 43,8 x 35,8 cm (central panel), 45,3 x 15,3 cm (each wing)	1480	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

12113-children.jpg	Although Drouais made his career primarily as a society portrait painter in the tradition of Largillière and Nattier, his portraits 'déguisés' were very different from theirs. Instead of court ladies depicted in the guise of antique goddesses, Drouais chose to depict his ladies and gentlemen (and especially their children) in pastoral guises (say, of shepherds and shepherdesses) or as members of different, perhaps less fortunate classes such as harvest workers or Savoyards. The present portrait depicts the two sons of the Duc de Bouillon dressed as Montagnards. One holds a marmot with a ribbon and the other plays a hurdy-gurdy, both activities associated exclusively with the people of the mountains especially in Savoy and in North Italy.The painting is signed lower centre: Drouais le fils 1756	DROUAIS, François-Hubert	The Children of the Duc de Bouillon	Oil on canvas, 86 x 130 cm	1756	genre	French	1701-1750

He holds out his arm toward that of the Lord, who, borne aloft amidst a flight of angels, stands out brightly against the shell of shadow of his huge purple mantle.

08420-figures.jpg	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene (see at Angeluccio) and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone"	CERQUOZZI, Michelangelo	Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue	Oil on canvas, 130 x 97 cm	1640s	landscape	Italian	1601-1650
19371-5hayez.jpg	"The painting is also known as Meditation on the Old and New Testaments.The darkened glance of the beauty in this painting is not really directed at the viewer. She is sunk in thought, looking out of the canvas in a pre-occupied way. In her right hand she holds a folio bearing the words ""Storia d'Italia"", this is to say a symbol of knowledge. Her left hand holds the symbol of faith, the Cross, that has played so great a part in Italy's history. Her naked breast is highly provocative when seen with the black cross of mourning. She is perhaps the allegory of Italy in the 19th century, and the gaze with which this figure of ""Italia"" confronts the viewer creates a suggestive, almost hypnotic effect. She seems to be in a state between waking and dreaming. This is meditation that has not yet reached a solution, meditation in which grief predominates"	HAYEZ, Francesco	Meditation on the History of Italy	Oil on canvas, 90 x 70 cm	1850	portrait	Italian	1801-1850
35473-11mythol.jpg	Venus and her son Cupid are being offered food and wine by Ceres, goddess of the fruits of the field, and Bacchus, god of wine. The subject comes from a line by the Roman comic poet Terence (d. 159 BC) which frequently figures in the emblem literature that developed from the mid-16th century: 'Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus' - without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus would freeze. Love is impossible without food and drink. Rather than depicting a boisterous feast, Rubens has opted for a rather restrained scene that must be read as a plea for moderation in pleasure.Rubens produced this painting a few years after his eight-year stay in Italy, where he was employed at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, and also in Rome. The knowledge of antiquity he gained then was put to use in this painting, as also in a later work on the same theme in 1614, (Royal Fine Arts Museum, Antwerp), Ceres' pose being taken from the Crouching Venus of the Hellenistic sculptor Doidalsas, dating from around 240-230 BC. Rubens certainly knew the marble copy in the Farnese collection in Rome (today in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples).What he particularly appreciated in Hellenistic and Roman sculpture was its formal dynamism, although he saw in ancient sculpture generally a realm of flawless, ideal nature. In painting from such antique models, he says in his De Imitatione Statuarum, a treatise 'on the imitation of sculpture', the statuary has to be humanised, translated into flesh and blood.

24925-metropo2.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine	MASTER of the Acts of Mercy	Giving Drink to the Thirsty (exterior)	Oil on fir panel, 74 x 47 cm	1460s	religious	Austrian	1451-1500

11385-interiox.jpg	This painting depicts an interior scene with elegant figures playing music. The figures in the imaginary palatial interior were formerly attributed to Dirck Hals.

17065-paris15.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 313, JH 1251.This picture shows an inviting restaurant in Asnières. Van Gogh's unique facility for communicating his feelings directly by means of his brushwork is already in evidence. The light and the associated atmospheric effects have become the actual subject of the picture, very much in the spirit of the Impressionists. Although still restrained, the painting is defined in terms of colour by contrasting complementary colours: blue and orange, red and green.By the middle of 1887 a dramatic change of style has occurred in van Gogh's work. Using these characteristically 'impressionist' motifs of a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, van Gogh seems to have been willing to experiment with Impressionist techniques as well. However, the painting lacks a sense of substance and conviction, which reflects his difficulty in feeling himself as part of the world he is portraying.In the two years van Gogh spent in Paris he tried to assimilate French Impressionism, only to find that a new generation of painters were questioning its premises regarding both subject-matter and style. His flirtation with Impressionist subject-matter was brief; encounters with the Neo-Impressionists led him to believe that Paris could no longer be the subject of modern French painting	GOGH, Vincent van	Restaurant de la Sir?ne at Asni?res	Oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm	Summer 1887, Paris	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
35316-sketch1.jpg	This painting is an oil sketch (modello) for the principal altarpiece in the east transept of the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg, built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) between 1696 and 1707. This altarpiece is one of the most important works from Rottmayr's later period. The modello is a smaller version of the six-meter high altarpiece and reproduces the elongation and distortion of the figures which create the perspective of the altarpiece itself.St Charles Borromeo was the intercessor for people stricken with the plague. In response to an outbreak of the plague epidemic in the city of Salzburg, processions are held and Holy Communion is administered following the example of St Charles Borromeo. Rottmayr defined the location of the event by depicting recognisable features of the Salzburg landscape and architecture.Rottmayr's style of painting was shaped by and bears the imprint of his schooling in the Italian, and above all Venetian, art of painting in the sixteenth century	ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael	Apotheosis of St Charles Borromeo	Oil on canvas, 130 x 58 cm	c. 1721	religious	Austrian	1701-1750
24307-10marko.jpg	Markó often interrupted his stay in Italy for the sake of paying a visit to Hungary. This work, made in 1853, is considered a rarity, because, except for a few works during the earliest period of his career, he never painted Hungarian landscapes. Although his art can largely be classified as late neo-classicist, this time Markó chose a romantic motif. He depicted the Puszta, the region of the country which is still thought to be the most special and the most interesting, with a sweep-pole well, its mandatory symbol. A rainbow glows in the stormy sky. One is reminded of the anxiety felt before a storm by the ponderous, dark clouds. Besides the subject of the painting, its style also shows the traits of romanticism, with special regards to its composition which is built on the contrast between light and dark.

14015-1zenob01.jpg	The Villa Zenobio in Santa Bona Nuova, near Treviso, was built between 1673 and 1689 and was profoundly reworked during the mid-eighteenth century when the garden wing was erected. The small entrance portego was decorated in the early years of the eighteenth century by Gregorio Lazzarini. In 1744, the villa was acquired by Sebastiano Uccelli (1695-1768) who can be credited with the renovation of the villa. He commissioned Francesco Fontebasso to paint frescoes in the ballroom of the new garden wing.Frescoes unfold across the ceiling and walls of the vast ballroom, as well as beneath the open gallery. The ceiling fresco depicts The Magnanimity of Scipio, while the wall frescoes focus on the narration of episodes from the life of Queen Zenobia and represent The Banquet of Zenobia and Triumph of Aureliano. However, the interpretation of these scenes is debated	FONTEBASSO, Francesco	View of the ballroom	Fresco	1745-50	interior	Italian	1701-1750
23081-6roadto.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church.This scene has the tragic cadence of a procession of Flagellants, like the ones used to travel along the roads of Umbria on Good Friday, accompanied by the singing of lauds and marching to the rhythm of their scourges	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Road to Calvary	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350
40266-organ_2.jpg	In 1469 the cover of the organ of the Cathedral in Ferrara was painted by Tura. The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. The shutters were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.Light is effectively rendered as an expressive device without becoming a particularly naturalistic component, striking here and there, helter-skelter, although a certain concentration on the left may be isolated. Highlights are also found on the right-hand edges of forms, especially in the canvas showing St George impaling the dragon. Color is equally antinaturalistic. The tight-fitting leather costume of the saint is outlined, pale maroon against a golden sky. His gray horse, ferociously participating in the confrontation, is accentuated by a calligraphic arrangement of thin red straps. There are strong echoes of Mantegna, perhaps in part filtered through Squarcione, in motives like the rendering of the winding trail with figures on the hill behind the princess and a tight application of paint, which permits abundant minuscule detail. Critics have called attention to connections with later Donatello, especially with his reliefs made for nearby Padua. These are difficult to isolate within the personal expressive idiom of the St George, except for the shared intensity in treating sacred figures and narratives	TURA, Cosm?

36317-angelapp.jpg	The biblical subject of this painting was rarely depicted. It represents the scene of an angel announcing to the aged wife of Manoah the birth of her son Samson.Saraceni was mostly active as a figure painter and executed only a few landscapes. His landscapes rely heavily on the example of the German Adam Elsheimer	SARACENI, Carlo	An Angel Appearing to the Wife of Manoah	Oil on copper, 41 x 56 cm	c. 1610	religious	Italian	1601-1650
12298-21badia.jpg	Painted with the 'Master of the Badia at Isola'. With regard to this anonymous master it is worth recording that in all probability he was at the beginning in such close relations with Duccio as to lend credibility to the opinion that Duccio's hand can be detected in some of his early works. As an example can be cited the very beautiful Madonna no. 593 in the Pinacoteca of Siena whose face is really so close to Duccio's Crevole Madonna that it could easily be attributed to him and dated to that period	DUCCIO di Buoninsegna	Madonna and Child (no. 593)	Tempera on wood, 63 x 49,5 cm	1280s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08528-1lands02.jpg	Cézanne's main work was done in landscapes. He painted the river valleys of the Ile-de-France and, above all, his beloved hard, bright, sunbaked Provence. Over the course of decades he never tired of walking the hills in order to paint the majestic profile of Mont Sainte-Victoire, often with the valley of the Arc in the foreground and the impressive intrusion of a lengthy new railway viaduct	CÉZANNE, Paul	Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley	Oil on canvas, 65 x 82 cm	1882-85	landscape	French	1851-1900
06604-holy_fam.jpg	"The Holy Family leaves us in little doubt as to why the second son of Pieter Bruegel was given the nickname ""Velvet"" Brueghel. It is a masterpiece of ""fine"" painting in which elements of floral still-life, landscape painting and devotional painting are combined into a harmonious whole. A magnificent garland of meticulously painted flowers and fruits reflecting the diversity of nature frames the idyllic scene like a triumphal arch. It forms the letter M for Mary, who is seated as in a ""beszlozzenen garten"" or hortus conclusus dominating the middle ground with the Christ child on her knee. Beside her are the angels and the lamb, slightly behind her is Joseph and in the background is a view of a landscape with grazing deer. The figures were painted by Pieter van Avont - an excellent example of the way specific painterly tasks were delegated according to artists' specializations within Netherlandish painting"	BRUEGHEL, Jan the Elder	The Holy Family	Oil on panel, 93,5 x 72 cm	c. 1623	religious	Flemish	1551-1600

18091-1orsini.jpg	"This little panel was part of a predella from an altarpiece of the Madonna, Angels and Saints, which was commissioned by the Confraternity of the Purification of the Virgin, in Florence. On October 23, 1461, the contract for the painting was drawn up. It is a remarkable document in the number and precision of its stipulations and instructions. The painter was asked to use Fra Angelico's altarpiece at San Marco as a model and to execute the entire work by his own hand, with the greatest care. One clause stated that ""...the said painting must go beyond all the good painting done up to now by the said Benozzo, or at least should be comparable in quality...""The artist scrupulously observed the conditions of the contract. His composition is clearly articulated, with the initial episode of the narrative placed in the middle ground.

41899-cafaggi.jpg	The picture showing the Villa Medicea at Cafaggiolo is one of the 14 paintings in lunette form which represent the Medici villas. They were made by artist in 1599-1602 for the third grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I.The Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo was one of the oldest and most favoured of the Medici family estates. The villa was reconstructed following designs of the architect Michelozzo in 1452, becoming a meeting place for some of the greatest intellectuals of the Italian Renaissance. The Medici visited it often: as a consequence, the villa was the scene of many momentous events in the history of the dynasty, ranging from the reception of Medici brides to the murder of a Medici wife	UTENS, Giusto	Villa Medicea, Cafaggiolo	Fresco	1599	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
25276-05educat.jpg	The Golden Legend, drawing on the apocryphal gospels, tells how the Virgin Mary was brought up as a child in the Temple at Jerusalem 'with other virgins'...and was visited daily of angels', since it had been foretold to her parents, Joachim and Anne, that their daughter was to be consecrated to the Lord as the 'chosen vessel' of Christ's Incarnation. The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character. Mary is seen in earlier examples teaching her young companions, sewing the priest vestments or being ministered to by angels who bring bread and water. But the favourite theme, especially in Counter-Reformation art, depicts her education in the strict sense, at the knee of her mother Anne, learning to read.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art	MAULBERTSCH, Franz Anton	The Education of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 60 x 30 cm	c. 1755	religious	Austrian	1751-1800

He was a Roman general in the army of Emperor Trajan's army who was converted to Christianity after seeing the crucified Christ in the antlers of a stag; he was to suffer a horrible martyr's death under the emperor Hadrian.

But as with Memling, the Virgin is here in an attitude of prayer (Nativity, Prado, Madrid; Floreins triptych, Memlingmuseum, Bruges). Formerly attributed to Van der Weyden and the Master of the Legend of St Catherine, it came to be regarded as a Bruges work by most art historians who expressed a view about it	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Nativity	Oil on oak panel, 35,8 x 30,5 cm	1475-1500	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

18487-selfport.jpg	Greuze was in his late 50s when he conceived of this portrait of himself. It was a difficult period for him personally, because his notoriously difficult marriage was finally coming apart, but at the same time he was painting some of his most important genre pictures. In these he created scenes from contemporary life that combined an unblinkered view of the world around him with a style derived from the grand manner of the traditional historical painter. His penetrating insight into his subjects' motivation and personality is also evident in the portraits and self-portraits of which he made many at this time.

08797-eligius.jpg	St Eligius, who was born c. 590 in Limousin, notably in the making of reliquaries has become one of the most popular saints of the Christian West. Ancient tradition credits him with extraordinary talent as a goldsmith.St Eligius in His Workshop remains to this day the best-known and best-loved painting of Petrus Christus. It shows two young fiancés who have brought the patron saint of goldsmiths a quantity of precious metal to be melted down and fashioned into rings as token of their love. Christus gives us an extremely detailed representation of the goldsmith's shop. Not only are there all the instruments of the trade, but also many liturgical objects, carefully arranged on shelves. There is also a convex circular mirror on the right-hand side of St Eligius's table, in an obvious allusion to the Arnolfini Marriage by Jan van Eyk. In it we can see the reflection of a square, with a couple of passers-by. Although the presence of the saint gives the work a religious dimension, this remains essentially a genre painting: that is, a representation of secular and commercial activities, a scene from everyday life	CHRISTUS, Petrus	St Eligius in His Workshop	Oil on panel, 98 x 85 cm	1449	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

24095-4judith.jpg	Once owned by King Charles I of England, this painting illustrates an episode from the Old Testament which relates how the Israelite Judith by guile killed the Assyrian general Holofernes and thus saved her beleaguered city. Painted with minute detail, Judith and her handmaiden finish their deed with tragic calm.Among Mantegna's works there are several representations of Judith that, without exception, show a comparatively peaceful scene in which Judith is placing the severed head of Holofernes in a bag. During the Baroque, in contrast, the dramatic central moment of the action was preferred, as Judith, often with great effort, decapitates Holofernes.

08037-leblond.jpg	A sister-in-law of Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Rosalba Carriera achieves the same airy lightness of touch as her relative in her portraits. These were done in pastel and in them she explored the finest shadings of her subjects' characters, the most fleeting of their moods. Thus, without falling either into the dangers of the encomiastic portrait or of the documentary, Rosalba matches the immediacy of pastel technique to the freshness of her psychological and social penetration of her subjects, offering an unrivalled picture of the society of her time. In the Elderly Lady the mature beauty of the noblewoman and her serene good-natured existence are conveyed with incomparable skill. No less typical of her work is the portrait of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac with its superb rendering of the physical features of the subject, catching immediately the wilful character of the prelate.The artist uses her pastels with consummate skill in conveying the fresh innocence of the Young Lady of the Le Blond Family	CARRIERA, Rosalba	Young Lady of the Le Blond Family	Pastel on paper, 34 x 27 cm	c. 1730	portrait	Italian	1701-1750
14509-burning.jpg	This work of Froment's maturity, which is indeed an epitome of his whole oeuvre, was commissioned by King René of Provence. This central panel of the triptych represents Moses before the Burning Bush; the figures kneeling in prayer on the wing are the donor and his wife, Jeanne de Laval, accompanied by saints (not reproduced here). In this work the painter has abandoned the occasional crudities of The Raising of Lazarus; only in the countenance of Moses are there reminiscences of the more rigid portraiture of the earlier altarpiece. Moses is struck with astonishment at the vision before him and the appearance of the angel. The vision occupies the upper centre of the picture: amidst a great circle of flaming rose bushes the Madonna appears in a richly draped mantle, holding the Child. Christ holds a mirror in his hand, in which both of them are reflected. The picture contains a number of emblematical representations. The combination of a number of unusual elements side by side is characteristic of mediaeval symbolism. It is evidence of the extraordinary cult of the Virgin in the Middle Ages that it is she who appears before Moses, and not God, as in the Old Testament	FROMENT, Nicolas	The Burning Bush	Wood, 410 x 305 cm	1476	religious	French	1451-1500

40348-01prato.jpg	Those sections of the fresco cycle that are attributed to Paolo in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption in Prato Cathedral display a perfect compositional organization, created through a precise perspective pattern that places the simple, elegant buildings and the numerous human figures within a perfectly balanced spatial rhythm. Each of the characters has a different expression, evidence of a research into facial characteristics which will later become typical of Uccello's painting.In the scene of the Disputation of St Stephen, for instance, the beautiful face of the saint and those of the characters standing around him are portrayed with strongly marked expressions, in some cases even grotesque, in the attempt at giving each one individual characteristics. Behind this group of figures there is an architectural construction that is reminiscent of Brunelleschi's buildings. The accuracy and the perfect perspective of the drawing of this building is repeated also in the constructions in the background of the Stoning of St Stephen, for this reason correctly attributed to Uccello; the scene of Stephen's martyrdom, on the other hand, is the work of Andrea di Giusto	UCCELLO, Paolo	Disputation of St Stephen	Fresco, 300 x 360 cm	c. 1435	religious	Italian	1401-1450
24384-pandemon.jpg	"In the 1820s Martin produced a series of paintings depicting scenes of disaster, set in infinite, visionary spaces and full of theatrical, nightmarish lighting effects. Their basic mood largely derived from the artist's familiarity with John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost and with the biblical Apocalypse.The Pandemonium of 1841 goes back to a passage in the first book of Milton's Paradise Lost, in which ""Pandemonium, the palace of Satan, rises suddenly built out of the deep."" In a diagonal perspective characteristic of Martin, a gigantic building complex extends along the waterfront. This recalls fantastic reconstructions of cities of antiquity. Martin's Satan, whose invocatory figure stands on a rocky outcrop in the right foreground, has the look of an ancient Greek hero. Like Achilles outside Troy, he appears with shield and feathered helmet, but commanding an army not of besiegers but of demons and damned souls in their Cyclopean city"	MARTIN, John	Pandemonium	Oil on canvas, 123 x 184 cm	1841	other	English	1801-1850

33318-closedey.jpg	"This small painting is one of the painter's best-known works and is typical of Redon's symbolism. It shows a female face framed by long hair, painted in delicate and thinly applied colours. The woman's eyes are closed, her gaze directed inwards. The unreal blue of the background distances the face in the same way as the horizon. The head, absorbed in itself, is not a portrait.

(Apostles 8, v. 60). Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe.

05555-12marull.jpg	According to Berenson, the sitter of this portrait is Michele Marullo (1453-1500), known as Tarcaniota, a Greek humanist, who was the guest of the Medici's between 1489 and 1495. Later, in 1496, he returned to Florence and married the woman poet Alessandra Scala. He left Florence in 1490 and soon after he died by drowning into the river Cecina.This painting can be considered an ideal scholar portrait, a forerunner of those portrayals of philosopher-heroes developed in the seventeenth century, e.g. by Luca Giordano.The painting is in a very poor state of preservation	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Portrait of a Man	Tempera on canvas transferred from wood, 49 x 35 cm	c. 1490	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

The painting, depicting the oath of Claudius Civilis and the Batavians in the sacred grove, is a fragment, the originally it was about 550 x 550 cm, arched above.This subject taken from the early history of the Netherlands was considered as a symbol of national independence and pride.

07998-magnani.jpg	"This scene is part of the frescoed frieze painted in 1588-91 by the Carracci in the salone on the piano nobile of the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. The frieze depicts in 15 scenes the stories of the founding of Rome. The iconographical program of the frieze precisely follows the story of ""Parallel Lives"" by Plutarch. Each scene is accompanied by a motto written on a scroll beneath each box.One of the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. The twin brothers were purported to be sons of the Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their murderous uncle, they were abandoned at birth and put into a basket that was then placed into the River Tiber. The basket ran aground and the twins were discovered by a female wolf. The wolf nursed the babies for a short time before they were found by a shepherd. The shepherd then brought up the twins.When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them. The brothers quarrelled over where the site should be and Remus was killed by his brother. This left Romulus the sole founder of the new city and he gave his name to it &#150; Rome. The date given for the founding of Rome is 753 BC.Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf is the first scene of the cycle. It was executed by Lodovico Carracci. The motto beneath the scene reads: ""LAESI NON NECATI ALIMVR"" (Wounded, not killed, we are fed)"	CARRACCI, Lodovico	Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf	Fresco	1588-91	historical	Italian	1551-1600
37843-delazara.jpg	This polyptych is one of the very few surviving work that is universally considered to be by Squarcione. In a frame designed in a sophisticated late Gothic style are four side saints conceived like coloured sculpture on marble bases, unrelated of the conception of the central image. The focus of devotion, St Jerome, is in a different scale and has a different background than the surrounding saints. Squarcione's awareness of Flemish painting is particularly evident in the central section of the altarpiece	SQUARCIONE, Francesco	De Lazara Altarpiece	Panel, 175 x 220 cm	1449-52	religious	Italian	1401-1450

19666-bridge1.jpg	Jan van der Heyden is best known for his townscapes, featuring cities such as Amsterdam, Delft, Brussels, and Cologne. In contrast to Gerrit berckheyde, he did not limit himself to more or less accurate renderings of reality. He regularly included in a single picture various buildings that are actually located in different parts of a city, or in different cities altogether.A city canal dominates this scene with a run-down stone bridge.

18085-5nicbari.jpg	St Nicholas was the bishop of Myra in Lycia (now in Turkey), which is why he is also known as Nicholas of Myra, and he died in about 350. His relics were stolen from Myra by pirates in 1087 and brought to Bari, which explains the saint's official name. He is holding three golden balls in his hand, which according to the so-called legend of the virgins he gave to three impoverished girls so that they would have a dowry befitting their station and would not be disgraced	GOZZOLI, Benozzo	St Nicholas of Bari (on the pillar)	Fresco	1464-65	religious	Italian	1451-1500

25095-ursula.jpg	The present panel can be considered among the finest examples of the Master's works. It can be seen as a continuation of the great influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on artists not only in his adopted city of Brussels, but throughout the whole of the Low Countries.Ursula was the daughter of the Christian King Dionotus of Dumnonia. At her father's insistence she agreed to marry the pagan Conan Meriadoc of Armorica, but not before a religious pilgrimage to Rome, circa 383, so that her suitor could be baptized. Upon their return from Rome, the couple stopped in Cologne, where they, along with her eleven thousand virgin attendants, were intercepted by the Huns, then in control of the German city. The pagan Hunnish prince asked Ursula to be his bride, but he was rejected. As retribution, Ursula was put to death by arrows, along with her attendants, all of whom were beheaded. Here the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara depicts St. Ursula punctured by a single arrow, her identifying symbol, as she protects her attendants with her finely rendered robe	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Barbara	St Ursula Protecting the Eleven Thousand Virgins with Her Cloak	Oil on panel, 38 x 27 cm	1470-1500	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

05871-chiswic1.jpg	Lord Burlington created the most complex example of Palladian architecture. Chiswick House, built between 1723 and 1729, is close to the villas of the Veneto in Italy. The ground plan, a square containing a central octagon, recalls Palladio's Villa Rotonda. A suite of interconnecting geometric spaces surround the domed central hall; they extend into apses with statues in the niches.The exterior combines multiple references to antiquity. The six Corinthian columns of the portico are from the temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome, the semi-circular, subdivided windows of the drum are reminiscent of Roman thermal baths. These features do not represent a literal quotation from ancient buildings but rather a version of the sixteenth-century interpretations which were accessible to Burlington through Palladio's drawings and buildings	BOYLE, Richard, 3rd Earl of Burlington	Exterior view	Photo	1725-29	other	English	1701-1750

00879-40west.jpg	Sixtus II (257-258) had charged archdeacon Lawrence with dispersing the church's wealth to the needy. This deed aroused the ire of Emperor Valerian who had claimed the treasure for himself, and formed the basis for the charges brought against Lawrence and his eventual execution.In its setting in the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican, the dramatic impact of this fresco is aided by its position between two recessed windows. The scene is set in the nave of a basilica, the type of architectural space which in St Lawrence distributing Alms was used only as a backdrop. Five columns are visible on either side, and they are equalled in volume and monumentality by the bishops and other churchmen who witness St Lawrence kneeling before the Pope. The end wall of the basilica and its niche bring emphasis to no figure in the composition, for none stands at the centre. The central axis runs instead through the communion chalice which passes between the Pope and the saint.It is remarkable that in this fresco cycle the pope and the prelates wear azure vests, then rarely used and presently non-existent	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Consacrates St Lawrence as Deacon	Fresco, 271 x 197 cm	1447-49	religious	Italian	1401-1450
41881-vendra04.jpg	The decoration of the portego is limited to the walls, on which there are three large landscapes set within ornate, faux architectural settings, also designed by Urbani. The west wall contains View of a Villa with a Pool and Landscape with Waterfall, while the opposite wall has View of a Large Renaissance Palace, divided into two parts by the staircase door. In the centre foreground of each landscape, on a trompe-l'oeil pedestal, is a faux-bronze statuary group representing the struggle between Good and Evil	URBANI, Andrea	View of a Villa with a Pool	Fresco	1764-68	landscape	Italian	1751-1800
34460-16rippl.jpg	"A great example of intimate interior pictures, it was awarded with the prize of the National Society of Art in 1906. It is closely linked  to the atmospheres and colours of ""White Wall with White Furniture"" and ""Flox and Filox"", but the intensity and variety of its colours are in favour of ""When One Lives on One's Memories"".  Its composition is superb: by applying space near and far he expresses the physical and psychic departure of  the old woman, the central figure of the picture, whose relationship to the world is slowly fading. Greyish-blue of the second space are in an intrinsic contrast with the cheerful foreground full of colours, with elements of Rippl's former pictures, e.g. the red of the colourful head kerchief. The mirror in the axis of  the window and  the door symbolizes that life and mortality cannot be helped: it is out of use and serves decoration only"	RIPPL-RÓNAI, József	When One Lives on Memories	Oil on cardboard, 70 x 104 cm	1904	genre	Hungarian	1851-1900
23992-5euphemi.jpg	St Euphemia has been placed in a stone arch decorated with garlands of fruit and leaves. She has been portrayed in the immediate foreground, bringing her close to the viewer. With her direct gaze, the life-size figure, accompanied by a lion, is open to dialogue with the viewer standing in front of her.St Euphemia was subjected to various forms of torture during the persecution of Christians under Emperor Diocletian. These are symbolized by a sword that has pierced her side and the lion biting her arm. The painting was damaged by fire in the late 18th century, so that the detail of the folds of her robe are no longer apparent	MANTEGNA, Andrea	St Euphemia	Distemper on canvas, 171 x 78 cm	1454	religious	Italian	1451-1500

06994-10incafe.jpg	Caillebotte often found his subjects near the family home by the river Yerres. In 1880 an acquaintance modelled for his lifesize portrait of a café regular. The subject, technique, colouring, use of space, and subtle deployment of the mirror, all have something of Manet or Degas. But Caillebotte outdid Manet in expressing an entire social psychology in this portrait of a good-humoured, unfooled, slightly crafty man of the lower middle class	CAILLEBOTTE, Gustave	In a Café	Oil on canvas, 155 x 115 cm	1880	portrait	French	1851-1900
06475-01baptis.jpg	"Pieter Bruegel the Elder was the most important figure in sixteenth-century Flemish painting, the founder of a dynasty of painters. His realistic painting of peasants in both his secular and religious works gave him the nickname of ""Peasant Bruegel"". A number of copies of this picture, both contemporary and dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have come down to us, and many of them are in museums in Flanders (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels), as well as in Bonn, Schwerin, Leningrad, Munich and Cracow, mostly produced with the co-operation of his sons, Pieter and Jan, and his workshop employees. This tends to indicate that the picture remained in Brussels for a long time, or was in a collection in another town in the Netherlands which was easily accessible to the public.The numerous copies and variants of this painting with its theme of the Holy Baptism can also be explained by the widespread growth of the Anabaptist movement in those years of religious turbulence and strife. The date of the painting coincides with a period of iconoclasm in the Netherlands.This picture is probably identifiable as that known to have been in the collection of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Governor of the Netherlands, in 1633. In this, the preaching Saint John the Baptist is virtually lost in the colourful throng of peasants, cripples, gipsies, mischievous children climbing trees, and trees painted with astounding realism. Even the river in the background and the distant church take a more prominent role in the whole than the impersonal figure of the saint in his hair-shirt"	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	The Sermon of St John the Baptist	Oil on wood, 95 x 160,5 cm	1566	religious	Netherlandish	1501-1550

21367-allegory.jpg	Legranée received several royal commissions in a busy life. In the Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin the figures are not strictly allegorical, apart from the sorrowing France behind the bed, for they represent the dauphine and the couple's sons (including the dead one who appears with a crown of stars for his dying father), the effect is of allegory rather than fact. And the idiom in which the picture is painted is certainly classical, much as interpreted by Batoni, though critics of the day it suggested Guido Reni	LAGRENÉE, Louis-Jean-François	Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin	Oil on canvas, 129 x 97 cm	1765	mythological	French	1751-1800

30619-washing.jpg	In the 1880s, Lombardy began to play an active part in Italian art. The movement that originated there declared its loyalty to the great Italian tradition, and was particularly interested in atmospherics of light, colour, and texture. In the 1890s, such work came into its own with divisionist or pointillist paintings.In the work of Pellizza, the most important Lombard Neo-Impressionist, the goals of the leading French pointillist, Seurat, were most consistently pursued. This was apparent not only in his relinquishing romantic natural scenes such as Impressionism favoured, and preferring an art based upon ideas; he also dispensed with clear outlines, and used strong contrasts of juxtaposed colours. His thematic range was great, and included curiously symbolic paintings such as Washing in the Sun	PELLIZZA DA VOLPEDO, Giuseppe	Washing in the Sun	Oil on canvas, 87 x 131 cm	1905	landscape	Italian	1851-1900
11367-5delaroc.jpg	Anglomania was in fashion in France in the 1820s and 1830s. Interest in British history, fuelled by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, was further stimulated by parallels drawn between recent events in France and the turbulent accounts of Tudors, Stuarts and the Civil War. The pictorial representation of British history may have been pioneered in Britain, but it was the Frenchman Paul Delaroche who gained a European reputation with the grand scenes drawn from it which he exhibited at the annual Paris Salon between 1825 and 1835. Popularised through mass-produced engravings, these set pieces, combining ostentatious antiquarianism with the pseudo-realism of bourgeois melodrama, in turn influenced the painters of national history in mid-Victorian Britain.The painting depicts the last moments on 12 February 1554 in the life of the seventeen-year old Jane Grey, a great granddaughter of Henry VII who was proclaimed Queen of England upon the death of young King Edward VI, a Protestant like herself. She reigned for nine days in 1553, but, through the machinations of the partisans of Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor, she was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death in the Tower of London.Delaroche, who based the painting on a sixteenth-century Protestant martyrology, has falsified the historical account the better to appeal to his contemporaries. Lady Jane Grey, a humanist-educated young married woman, was in fact executed out of doors. Attended by two gentlewomen, probably no less stoical than she, she resolutely made her own way to the block. She could not have worn a white satin dress of nineteenth-century cut with a whalebone corset, and her hair would have been tucked up, not streaming down over her shoulders. But a painting cannot be judged by the criteria of historical accuracy. Much more applicable to this particular picture are the standards of popular melodrama and tableau vivant.As on a stage, the heroine gropes her way towards the audience, gently guided by the elderly Constable of the Tower whose massive, dark, male presence acts as a foil to her own. A spotlight trained on her from above complements the dim stage lighting, reflecting from her immaculate dress and the straw which spills over into the front row of the stalls. The emotions of each actor are carefully delineated and distinguished, and we are left in no doubt as to the character of each even of the lady in the background who turns her back on the terrible sight	DELAROCHE, Paul	The Execution of Lady Jane Grey	Oil on canvas, 246 x 297 cm	1833	historical	French	1801-1850

32267-19gather.jpg	It was already apparent to Poussin's contemporaries that the artist had given much thought, in The Israelites Gathering Manna, to the means by which painting could unfold a sequence of events before the eyes of the viewer. The artist combines selected aspects of the biblical story into one scene, so as to illustrate the scale of the Israelites' divine rescue from hunger and misery.This painting can be considered a variation on the Raphael fresco, The School of Athens, in the Vatican. Moses in particular, in his draperies and pointing gesture, directly cites the figure of Plato in Raphael's fresco. Poussin has simply transformed the latter's architectural backdrop into a rock formation and rotated the setting - which in the fresco lies parallel to the pictorial plane - as if on a turntable towards the right, so that it now leads away at a diagonal into the depths	POUSSIN, Nicolas	The Jews Gathering the Manna in the Desert	Oil on canvas, 149 x 200 cm	1637-39	religious	French	1601-1650
28588-paris5.jpg	Flags were flown on 30 June, 1878, to mark the opening of the Great Exhibition. On that day, a sea of flags was fluttering in the wind, and countless people filled the streets. Monet chose a high vantage point in order to emphasize the huge gathering of people. Viewed at close quarters, the milling throng gives the illusion of an ethereal carpet of colour. It is not until one is at a certain distance from the painting that the concrete aspect of the picture comes into focus, and the people on the streets become recognizable as well as the individual flags, which look as though they have been released from the façades of the houses to the left and right	MONET, Claude	Rue Montorgueil in Paris, Celebration of 30 June 1878	Oil on canvas, 81 x 51 cm	1878	historical	French	1851-1900

40992-02jeanbo.jpg	Although no mid-fourteenth century panel painting has come down to us, we can imagine what it may have been like in regarding this portrait of Jean le Bon, which is at the same time the earliest example of portraiture north of the Alps. The painter's brush is used with remarkable assurance, obviously practised in the creation of larger compositions as well. The artist has painted the sitter in profile against a golden background. The very individual character of the face is painted with great realism. A faintly perceptible smile hovers on the lips, the hair is red, the eyes blue. Without the inscription above his head 'Jehan, roi de France', one would hardly imagine it the portrait of a royal personage, a king whose life was full of vicissitudes, ruling during the hardships of the Hundred Years' War	UNKNOWN MASTER, French	Portrait of Jean le Bon, King of France	Wood, 60 x 44 cm	c. 1360	portrait	French	1351-1400
09498-1wedding.jpg	The Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.In this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory	CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM	The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis	Oil on canvas, 246 x 419 cm	1593	mythological	Dutch	1551-1600
28641-1vario16.jpg	In the spring of 1889 Monet was the guest of the poet and composer Maurice Rollinat in Fresselines, in the valley of the Creuse between Orléans and Limoges. He painted 23 landscapes here, treating motifs in different versions. The present painting belongs to a group of eight compositions which differs only in the condition of light	MONET, Claude	Valley of the Creuse (Sunlight Effect)	Oil on canvas, 65 x 92 cm	1889	landscape	French	1851-1900
15231-4recamie.jpg	This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. David started the portrait of Madame Récamier in 1800 which was never finished. (However, incidentally, this portrait helped a contemporary item of furniture to become known under her name.) When the master learned that the lady had also commissioned his pupil Gérard to paint her, he is said to have refused any further service.In David's portrait, noble simplicity, expressed by the simple dress and the Spartan decoration, is also eloquent in the open face. This might well appear more to the modern viewer than Gérard's version, which was judged to be more representative and flattering at the time. And comparisons with portraits of Madame Récamier by other artists suggest that Gérard had achieved a better likeness than David. The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.Gérard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation. Her low-cut bodice is seductive, the red curtain flatters the subject and gives the flesh a rosy tint. Where David gave the beautiful woman a rather severe touch around the mouth, Gérard embellishes her features with the hint of a gentle smile, making her look younger. By contrast, David's portrait in the antique manner looks rather forced. Perhaps these were the reasons why his painting was never finished. Madame Récamier gave Gérard's portrait of her to her admirer Prince Augustus of Prussia, a nephew of Frederick II, who had met the French beauty at the salon of Madame de Sta&#235;l. For state reasons a marriage was impossible, but in the painting Madame Récamier was ever present in the palace which Schinkel furnished for the Prince in 1817.After the death of the Prince the portrait was returned to Madame Récamier	GÉRARD, François	Madame Récamier	Oil on canvas, 255 x 145 cm	1805	portrait	French	1801-1850
25137-lucretia.jpg	Dr. Ellen Konowitz has recently reascribed all the panel paintings previously given to Dirck Vellert (who is known through his drawings, prints and stained glass) to the Master of the Lille Adoration, named for a painting in the Musée des Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. As the artistic production of this master continues to be more clearly defined and studied from the technical point of view, it has become evident that some works in the oeuvre of Jan Gossart most likely belong to this group as well: the Holy Family in Saint Louis, the Lucretia in a private collection, and the Portrait of a Man in Hamilton.This master was influenced in part by Gossart's works in the 1520s but never entirely abandoned his attachment to Antwerp Mannerism	MASTER of the Lille Adoration	Lucretia	Oil on panel, 46 x 37 cm	c. 1520-25	historical	Flemish	1501-1550

18921-21pardon.jpg	Guérin's Napoleon Pardoning the Rebels at Cairo has a grain of truth, since Napoleon had shown clemency to the Mamluk leaders of the 1798 rising - but only after the slaughter of most of the insurgents. Guérin burnishes Napoleon's myth subtly, placing his hero to the rear and rather dwarfed by those he has pardoned, in a sort of inverted modesty. If the rebels are allowed dignity in defeat, it is to emphasize the magnanimity of the victor.

09138-diane.jpg	Only two signed paintings by François Clouet are known to exist, of which this, generally regarded as one of the great masterpieces of the French Renaissance art, is one. The subject, shown seated in her bath, traditionally was believed to be the famous beauty, Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566), a favourite of Henry II and virtual ruler of France. However, this identification is now rejected, and the dating, placed either in the 1550s or around 1571 is debated. Diane do Poitiers. Other candidates for the identity of the sitter are Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) and Marie Touchet, mistress to Charles IX.This is the classic portrayal of a Royal mistress in her official role, cool, beautiful, aloof, bejewelled even in her bath, accompanied by the strappings of her state: fine rooms, a noble child in the arms of its leering, accomplice-nurse, the sly Love-child stealing the fruits, the flower of passion in her hand.Regarding the several influences, Titian's influence has been cited. The motif of the servant in the background performing a domestic chore is seen as deriving from the Venus of Urbino. The painting also shows affinities to the highly polished surfaces and icy eroticism of Bronzino. The pose of the woman in the bathtub was derived from a composition by Leonardo, known as the Monna Vanna (now lost	CLOUET, François	A Lady in Her Bath	Oil on wood, 92 x 81 cm	c. 1571	portrait	French	1551-1600

30955-belisari.jpg	The theme of Belisarius was much in vogue from the 1770s, and in addition to Jacques-Louis David, rival artists of David's own generation, such as Pierre Peyron and François-André Vincent, had painted their own versions of the subject. In Peyron's work, Belisarius is recognized by a peasant who had served under him, and praised as their protector and saviour by the rural family that now give him hospitality	PEYRON, Jean-François-Pierre	Belisarius Receiving Hospitality from a Peasant Who Had Served under Him	Oil on canvas, 93 x 132 cm	1779	historical	French	1751-1800
40383-2quarat1.jpg	"The predella, today in the Museo Arcivescovile in Florence, belonged to an altarpiece that has been lost (but was originally painted for the church of San Bartolomeo at Quarate). It is stylistically close to the Prato frescoes, and it consists of three scenes: St John on Patmos, the Adoration of the Magi and Saints John and Ansano.Although some scholars do not believe it is the work of Uccello, it can be placed chronologically in the group of paintings accepted as Uccello's work. As certain critics have pointed out, the Quarate predella shows the same interest in narrative, lively colours and description of details which is typical of Uccello's production in the years when he was working on the Prato frescoes (1435-40). A feeling of abstraction pervades these scenes, today no more than a group of fragments of faded and almost undecipherable images, in which we can make out a few architectural structures shown in accurate perspective and some monks laid out according to geometric patterns. In the extravagant choice of colours Uccello appears to have given his fantasy free rein; in fact, as Vasari noted, ""he did not pay much attention to the rule of consistency in colour, as was usual in the painting of stories; for he made the fields blue, the cities red, and the buildings the colour he felt like."

07313-margaret.jpg	This panel depicting St Margaret of Antioch was painted while Candid was living in Florence, and it shows the strong influence of Vasari. According to legend, St Margaret was cast into prison by the governor or Antioch and was swallowed whole by the devil in the form of a dragon. Armed with a cross, she pierced its belly and split the monster open, allowing her to walk free. She was eventually beheaded.The painting had a companion piece representing St Catherine of Alexandria whose cult was often linked to that of St Margaret's	CANDID, Peter	St Margaret of Antioch	Oil on panel, 51 x 34 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
15483-0chapel.jpg	"""... He did a chapel in Santissima Trinita for Francesco Sassetti with stories of St Francis, an admirable work, remarkable for its grace, finish and delicacy"" (Vasari).Francesco Sassetti had gained his wealth as a partner in the French branches of the Medici bank in Avignon and Lyon. He also spent over ten years representing the Medici bank in Genoa and occasionally in Geneva. But he was not always successful later on in his role as the chairman of the bank, and in 1484 was replaced by Giovanni Tornabuoni. By the end of the 1470s, Sassetti had already acquired the rights of patronage to a small side chapel, the second to the right of the choir in the Florentine church of Santissima Trinita. It was probable at this time that Ghirlandaio was commissioned to paint the chapel, which he decorated with frescoes between 1482 and 1485.The donor and his wife had themselves portrayed as life-sized figures kneeling in prayer at the side of the altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds. The donors are adoring the Christ Child, just like the shepherds in the panel painting. An incomplete inscription under their portraits names the day on which the chapel was consecrated, 25 December 1485, hence also the date by which it would have been completed. This year corresponds with the complete inscription on the altarpiece. In the Sassetti Chapel the artist combined secular, religious, and classical themes to produce a unique masterpiece.In the scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of contemporaries and views of Florence: he recreated religious events to the Florence of his day. In contrast to the newly built Saint Fina Chapel, the Sassetti Chapel was old and in the Gothic style. On each of its three walls Ghirlandaio painted two scenes from the life of Saint Francis, completed by a seventh fresco in the tympanum over the arched entrance to the chapel. At the crown of the entrance arch, the Sassetti coat of arms is surrounded by a garland of fruit, a sculptural work made of terracotta. The fresco in the tympanum above shows a sibyl prophesying Christ's dominion over the world to Emperor Augustus. The fresco idealizes the classical period as the precursor to the Christian age, and this provides a link with the chapel's high point, the altarpiece, which depicts the birth of Christ. The grisaille figure of David outside the chapel can also be interpreted in this way.On the two side walls of the chapel are the black marble sarcophagi of Francesco Sassetti and his wife Nera Corsi, set into niches with round arches. Here the sculptural decorations are dominated by classical motifs; the sculptor Giuliano da Sangallo is sometimes identified as the artist. The tomb niches are framed by grisaille frescoes, in which Ghirlandaio cites motifs from classical coins. Above each are two monumental frescoes by Ghirlandaio, which clearly owe a debt to traditional images. There are still echoes of the pictorial order established by Giotto in Assisi over 160 years earlier. Ghirlandaio studied Giotto's frescoes in the Bardi Chapel, dating from about 1325, in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence, and made direct use of them"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	View of the Sassetti Chapel	Fresco	1483-85	interior	Italian	1451-1500
05439-110madon.jpg	This painting shows the synthesis of trends that formed the style of Botticelli's painting. The composition of the painting resembles Lippi's art, but the figures are more delicately blended into the painting and their expressions and poses are more complicated.Behind the monumental, very sculptural figures is a broad, hilly landscape with a river. The boy-like angel appears to have just this moment stepped through the gap in the wall and come up to Mary and the child; he is presenting them with a bowl decorated with ears of grain and full of grapes. The Christ Child is blessing the gifts, which symbolize the bread and wine of the Eucharist.

22942-09ridott.jpg	"Pietro Longhi was first a pupil of Balestra and then of Crespi whose art was the source of his realism, which expressed a sober and sincere inner world, and a delight in detailed and fresh narrative. He conveyed his realism with wit and ease, whereas the immediacy with which he approached the landscape enriched his painting with a unique quality. Up to a certain point these elements can be discerned in pre-revolution French painting (Watteau, Chardin, Boucher and Lancret), whose influence also made itself felt in Pietro Longhi's realism. Only here and there did grotesque features appear in his art; he saw his figures with the eye of a sage and a gentle and witty impertinence is to be found in many of the scenes he depicted.Pietro Longhi became, by means of his genre-painting, one of the most faithful chroniclers of his age, and one who conjured up a regrettably vanished civilization. It should be borne in mind, however, that his connection with Goldoni and the teachings of Emilia encouraged him, through the observation of reality, to perform a kind of analysis of ""social depths""; he did not want to cause an upheaval but only wanted to point out &#151; perhaps tendentiously &#151; the ineptitude of a declining class of society. Although he did not pass sentence, he allowed his opinion to be known, being fully aware that changes were imminent. Sometimes he would ironically represent certain dandies, abbots and virgins"	LONGHI, Pietro	Il Ridotto	Oil on canvas	1740s	genre	Italian	1701-1750
14977-tahiti23.jpg	In 1889 Gauguin had painted a pair of works entitled Women Bathing (Life and Death) and Woman in the Waves (Ondine). The latter (in the Cleveland Museum of Art) depicts a naked woman, seen from behind, cast adrift in the waves, and in Fatata te miti he has reused the same subject, setting her within a Tahitian genre scene. In Ondine, Gauguin had treated the myth of the water-sprite who can only become human after having a child fathered by a man. Once again, he has explored the theme of the joy of sexual union as an essentially liberating activity, hinted at in the alternative title for The Loss of Virginity: The Awakening of Spring. In Fatata te miti the sexual abandonment is seen as part of the natural rhythm of Polynesian life (the two women do not appear perturbed at the presence of the fisherman in the background of the work), a notion that was integral to the highly popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read before visiting Tahiti and which was calculated to appeal to a Parisian audience	GAUGUIN, Paul	By the Sea (Fatata te Miti)	Oil on canvas, 68 x 92 cm	1892	landscape	French	1851-1900
38903-00bagli1.jpg	The frescoes decorating the main hall of the villa in Massanzago in the Province of Padua were attributed until the 1980s to various eighteenth-century painters, such as Jacopo Guarana, Giovanni Battista Crosato or Giambattista Pittoni. However, it turned out that the frescoes are the early works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Obvious stylistic and iconographic similarities between these frescoes and other early Tiepolo works were pointed out.The work at the Villa Baglioni began immediately after the wealthy Venetian publisher Giambattista Baglioni acquired in 1718 the seventeenth-century villa in Massanzago. The frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main hall, illusionistically breaking through the walls and creating a boundless space, thanks to the faux architectural structure conceived by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, who henceforth would be Tiepolo's most frequent collaborator, working on almost all of his large-scale decorative projects in Venice and the Veneto.The theme of the frescoes is the Myth of Phaethon, based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. The principal episode, Phaethon Asking His Father to Let Him Drive the Chariot of Sun, is staged on the east wall. The opposite wall is divided into two parts by the doors that lead into the hall from the monumental staircase. The right portion of the wall contains the Fall of Phaethon, the left part shows the Heliads, sisters of Phaethon. The frescoes on the short walls depict monochrome figures of the Four Regions of the World. The ceiling, which opens up to a faux sky, contains a depiction of The Triumph of Aurora	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	View of the main hall	Fresco	1719	interior	Italian	1701-1750

37103-1apostl2.jpg	The individual apostles cannot be identified with the exception of Peter and John, who stand in the panel to the left of the Christ-Thomas grouping. The idea of presenting pairs of apostles in debate is borrowed from the bronze doors that Donatello created for the Old Sacristy at San Lorenzo, Florence. Signorelli borrowed not only some of the compositional features of Donatello's reliefs but also specific iconographic details. Like Donatello, he depicts his apostles barefoot and draped in classical garments, eschewing any identifying attributes and even halos	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Pair of Apostles in Dispute	Fresco, 238 x 200 cm	1477-82	religious	Italian	1451-1500

09037-12sylvia.jpg	Claude's very last picture, the Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia is one of Claude's purest inspirations from the poetry of Virgil.In the painting the yellows have faded completely, leaving a bluish tinge over the whole, and the entire surface has been abraded. As a result the picture has an unnatural and ghostly feeling. The composition is one of Claude's most calculated, with trees, distant landscape and figures in total harmony. The Deruet-like figures are more.prominent than usual, with their bright blues and reds. The story is a tragic one: Ascanius accidentally shoots the stag of Sylvia, which unleashes a brutal war of revenge. It is fitting that Claude should have ended his career on this theme without depicting brutality, as it sums up his gentleness of temperament as an artist.The painting was executed for the Principe Colonna and was still in the collection in 1783	CLAUDE LORRAIN	Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia	Oil on canvas, 120 x 150 cm	1682	landscape	French	1651-1700

07586-53mercy0.jpg	From the fiefs of the Colonna family Caravaggio took refuge in Naples, in 1606. There he began to work again with his usual, astounding speed. Early in January 1607 he was paid for the immense altarpiece commissioned to him by the Pio Monte di Misericordia (where it may still be seen today). The painting shows the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is very complicated in its organization. Caravaggio actually had to add a series of figures (two angels and the Madonna and Child, the latter painted later) in the upper part of the painting, which make the composition of the picture the most complex, perhaps, in any of his works. Caravaggio did not paint exemplary episodes intended to stir the viewer to religious piety through the illustrative emphasis of gestures and feelings. Rather, he entrusted the educational effectiveness of his works to the evidence of things in themselves, in the conviction that nothing should be added above and beyond what is already contained in the intrinsic eloquence of the various poses.The seven acts of mercy represented on the painting are the following. On the right appear the (1) burial of the dead and the episode of the so-called Carita Romana (Cimon's daughter giving her father suck in prison), which contains at once the two charitable acts of (2) visiting prisoners and (3) feeding the hungry. (4) Dressing the naked appears in the foreground, symbolized by St. Martin and the beggar. Next to this scene, the host and St. James of Compostela allude to the (5) offering of hospitality to pilgrims. (6) Relieving the thirsty is represented by Samson drinking from the ox jaw. The youth on the ground behind the beggar of St. Martin may also represent the merciful gesture of (7) caring for the sick.We readily apprehend the artist's power of synthesis, which concentrates a conceptual content that is potentially quite dispersive, in the model behavior of a few figures. The large painting was widely copied and studied by seventeenth-century Neapolitan painters, who drew ideas and formal devices from it	CARAVAGGIO	The Seven Acts of Mercy	Oil on canvas, 390 x 260 cm	c. 1607	religious	Italian	1551-1600

29969-winter_s.jpg	Isack van Ostade was the short-lived younger brother of the painter of scenes from peasant life, Adriaen van Ostade. They were both born, lived and worked in Haarlem, and Isack was a pupil of his brother who was eleven years his senior. Isack joined the guild in 1643. His earliest paintings - the first dated picture is from 1639 - are peasant interiors dependent on Adriaen's, but towards the end of his brief career he became more interested in outdoor scenes and produced a series of beautiful and original landscapes, often set in winter. This deliberately picturesque view, its low viewpoint serving to outline the wooden bridge against the sky, is one of his finest paintings. It is rich in its treatment of the details of peasant life, whose harsh aspects (as seen, for example, in the figure of the man labouring under his load of faggots) are relieved by the pleasure taken by the child in the anticipation of skating on the frozen river.

20241-ziegler.jpg	Huber was a German painter, draughtsman and woodcut artist, who, after Altdorfer, was the most important member of the Danube school. He worked in Regensburg and Passau. Few paintings by him are known and it is in woodcuts and drawings that his lyrical approach to landscape can best be seen.The sitter of this portrait, Jacob Ziegler, was a scholar who lived a wandering life in Europe. In his old age he lived in the house of the Bishop of Passau.

37416-portlady.jpg	This small panel was probably made in the 1670s, when Slingeland executed most of his delicate, genre-like portraits. It depicts in great detail a young woman standing in half-length and in three-quarter profile, with her head turned to the left, facing the viewer. In her right hand the lady holds a single pink rosebud; her left arm rests gracefully on a stone balustrade.The painting is a betrothal or marriage portrait and in 1773 had a pendant, a portrait of a man with a statue of Mercury	SLINGELAND, Pieter Cornelisz. van	Portrait of a Lady Holding a Rose	Oil on panel, 20 x 17 cm	1670s	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700
41169-x_sebast.jpg	This panel was one of the side wing of an altar triptych which the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder produced for the Bishop of Eichst&#228;tt. The local patron saints Willibald and Walburga, adored by the bishop, occupied the central panel, which is now in the Historical Museum in Bamberg. The side wings with Sts Sebastian and Roch on the inner sides are still in the possession of the diocese.The representation of St Sebastian does not follow the pictorial tradition, he is only recognisable in the general iconographic context and from the arrow, his attribute, which he holds in his hands. His contemporary dress and facial features suggest a portrait of Count Philipp of Solms-Lich as a historiated portrait. Count Philipp of Solms-Lich (1468-1544) was an imperial councilor under Maximilian I and Charles V, and at the electoral court of Frederick the Wise	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	St Sebastian	Tempera on wood	c. 1520	religious	German	1501-1550
42742-racehors.jpg	Horace Vernet enjoyed royal patronage, one of his earliest commissions was a group of ten paintings depicting Napoleon's horses.

21482-eremiti1.jpg	Shortly after the completion of the ceiling in the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese, Annibale and his pupils, who included Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco, were asked to provide decorations for a palazzetto behind Palazzo Farnese, across the Via Giulia. The decoration consisted of mainly landscapes. In keeping with the character of the building, a casino in a garden, they represented mythological episodes. A few years later, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese decided to add a small room (Camerino degli Eremiti) to the Palazzetto Farnese as a Christian retreat where he could withdraw for his devotion. Giovanni Lanfranco was responsible for its entire decoration which consisted of four large frescoes, and nine ceiling panels, only two of which survived, Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels and Christ Served by Angels	LANFRANCO, Giovanni	Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels	Oil on canvas, 109 x 78 cm	c. 1616	religious	Italian	1601-1650
11201-1880s_20.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	Woman Combing Her Hair	Pastel on paper on cardboard, 87 x 57 cm	1887-90	genre	French	1851-1900
24868-madonna1.jpg	Although in the 1440s Filippo Lippi explored a variety of solutions for showing the Madonna and Child within or against an architectural niche, with the Child resting on a parapet - the finest example is that in Washington - in none of these is there a similar illusionistic intent, with the parapet and tabernacle window conceived as though projecting into the viewer's space. The point of reference for the author of this painting was certainly Donatello' Pazzi Madonna.The artist of this picture certainly spent time in the workshop of Filippo Lippi: the spherical heads and curiously boneless hands relate to Lippi's works of the late 1430s - especially the Tarquinia Madonna and the Barbadori Altarpiece	MASTER of Pratovecchio	Madonna and Child	Tempera on wood, 99 x 70 cm	1440s	religious	Italian	1451-1500
23627-refector.jpg	The Genoese Alessandro Magnasco was taught by his father Stefano and a little known Milanese painter, Filippo Abbiati, and began by painting in a conventional seventeenth-century style. During his stay in Florence at the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, he became acquainted with the work of Salvator Rosa and the etchings of Callot, and under their influence developed a content and style of his own. His themes were bizarre, different from anything to be seen in Genoa, Milan, or indeed anywhere in Italy; nor did his manner of painting resemble that of any other artist in Italy. He depicted imaginary scenes, capriccios in many of which monks are seen in strange settings or tiny figures in stormy landscapes. In his paintings, which are usually small, the figures are oddly elongated, the strokes of the brush vibrating and restless; indeed, everything seems to be in flickering movement.The number of people depicted in this painting and the richness of the decorations lead us to think that this may have been the General Chapter of the Franciscan Order	MAGNASCO, Alessandro	The Observant Friars in the Refectory	Oil on canvas, 176 x 143 cm	c. 1740	religious	Italian	1701-1750
07880-1camerin.jpg	The Villa Caldogno is the result of one of Palladio's early projects. Its construction began in 1542, at the behest of Losco Caldogno, an aristocrat and silk merchant from Vicenza, who had inherited an agricultural complex and fields in Caldogno the year before. Construction of the building and the decoration of the interiors extended over a long period of time, brought to completion only in 1570.The fresco decoration of the loggia, the Central Hall, and two other rooms (Room of Scipio and Room of Sofonisba) was completed by Giovanni Antonio Fasolo and Giovanni Battista Zelotti by 1570. In 1646, the interior distribution of the space was modified and a new small room (camerino), connecting the Room of Scipio and the Room of Sofonisba, was frescoed by the young Venetian painter Giulio Carpioni. These frescoes illustrate scenes from Guarino Guarini's Pastor Fido (The Faithful Shepherd). The room was partly frescoed earlier by an unidentified sixteenth-century painter with some episodes taken from Torquato Tasso's Aminta.Carpioni's paintings in the camerino unfold in three compartments on the walls, each containing an episode from the poem; the compartments are embellished along the side edges with refined, colourful floral festoons. The scenes depict: The Coronation of the Nymph Amaryllis, Winner of the Kissing Competition; The Pursuit of Corsica by a Satyr; and the Wounding of Dorinda, Mistaken by the Shepherd Silvio for One of His Prey. In the corners of the room, as a connective element, are two unusual, extremely lively candelabra. Completing the cycle, above the two doors are the scenes Cupid Taming the Lion and The Struggle between Erote and Anterote	CARPIONI, Giulio	View of the Pastor Fido camerino	Fresco	1646	interior	Italian	1601-1650

34926-07gartem.jpg	The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. When establishing the narrative composition, priority was given to the arrangement of narrative events rather than to the continuous narrative flow. Thus, popular subjects, such as Noah's Ark, were made to stand out in spectacular fashion.As was common in the Middle Ages, the artist who created this picture showed the ark as a lateral elevation. Judging by its hull, the ark is a Viking ship with a stem fortified by monsters, and a three-story superstructure and small wheel-house just as described in the Bible. Animals look out through the round-arched windows, and Noah's family crouch above	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French	Noah's Ark	Fresco	c. 1100	religious	French	1051-1100

07775-60meetin.jpg	"Canvas No. 6 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The same colour tone and mood as in the Apotheosis, but used in a much more self-assured perspective composition, appears again in the Meeting between Pope Cyriacus and the Pilgrims. Scholars do not agree on the dating of this canvas and suggestions go from 1491, the same year as the Apotheosis of St Ursula, to 1493, the year of the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula. Even the question of the identification of the character in red standing next to Pope Cyriacus as Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Humanist and the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1493 after having fallen out of grace in Venice, is used in different ways by the advocates of the various chronological theories. The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490.The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls"	CARPACCIO, Vittore	The Pilgrims Meet the Pope	Tempera on canvas, 281 x 307 cm	c. 1492	religious	Italian	1501-1550

28714-y_christ.jpg	This is the primary signed and dated version of three panels representing the young Christ which Montagna executed in or around 1507 when the artist was in Verona.The iconography of representations of the young Christ was well established in the Veneto in the 16th century. The inspiration for many of these representations probably depended on a lost prototype by Leonardo or on Albrecht Dürer's Christ Among the Doctors, which was in Venice in the early 16th century.The panel is signed, inscribed and dated on the ledge: CHRISTVS VIVIFICAT SVAM FIGVRAM .

The wings show the two St Johns with the `living' figures of Adam and Eve in niches on the exterior (seen when the wings are closed).For the first time the painting includes the italianate motif of putti stretching festoons across the scene at the top.

32150-y_bull.jpg	In the work of Paulus Potter views of nature and animals are seen for their own sake, and not as a backdrop for human action. Potter can paint equally well the bright sunlight and the cool air, but his real fame lies with his penetrating portraits of animals. His best-known work is the life-size Young Bull, an unusual heroization of a single animal, a counterpart to the monumental trend of Ruisdael and Cuyp.Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages. The ancient Greek painter Zeuxis used a similar method; when he painted his portrait of Helen in the city of Croton he chose five beautiful virgins, in order to copy the finest features of each, for in one woman he felt he could not find perfect beauty.What makes this painting so special is the fact that Potter painted something as ordinary as a bull on such a grand scale - which had never been done before. And despite this large size, he paid great attention to the smallest details.During the nineteenth century the Young Bull by the twenty-two-year-old Potter ranked close in fame to the Night Watch of Rembrandt. Later generations have been less captivated by Potter's fidelity to nature when he worked life-size. Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless. Atmosphere enters the picture only in the lovely distant view on the right, where a sunny light plays upon the cattle in the meadows and on the woods, making this passage one of his loveliest landscapes. Potter is more consistent on a small scale, and his cabinet pieces show him at his best.	POTTER, Paulus	The Young Bull	Oil on canvas, 236 x 339 cm	1647	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
13632-09ferenc.jpg	According to the Bible, the older brothers who were jealous of their father's love sell Joseph to the Ishmailites (Book IV of the Old Testament). The picture  shows the most tragic scene of the betrayal. Joseph, stripped to the waist, is seized and led to the merchants in white burnous who have just arrived. Ferenczy's picture, which is the largest of all in size, opens prospects: in the background of the scene  there is a huge plain area with figures lining up in the foreground. It is not necessary to know the biblical story to understand what is going on. The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background. The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.The picture was painted from beginning to end in the open air, as it is known from Valér's letter to his father, the size of the picture must have presented a lot of technical problems.

17802-706goya.jpg	Like many other uncommissioned works, the subject of this painting has been interpreted in various ways and it has borne several descriptive titles. The woman reading the letter has been thought to be a portrait. One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'. It has also been suggested that Goya intended this painting as a pendant to Time and the Old Women. The two canvases are almost exactly the same size, were acquired for the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille, at the same time and have the same provenance. But there seems to be no obvious connection between the subjects of the two paintings and Time and the Old Women, which is known to have been in Goya's possession in 1812, is almost certainly a slightly earlier work. There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings. But the composition is less contrived and, as in many other works, chiefly the uncommissioned ones, it appears to be based on a scene that the artist had witnessed and recorded on the spot or from memory. This was one of four paintings by Goya in the collection of King Louis Philippe which had been obtained in Madrid from Goya's son	GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de	Les Jeunes or the Young Ones	Oil on canvas, 181 x 122 cm	1812-14	other	Spanish	1801-1850
24478-portrait.jpg	The painting is in a poor state of conservation, the colours have altered dramatically. However, the portrait has an extraordinary presence. The face, defined by its sharp contour, is modeled like sculpture. The three-dimensional effect of the mazzocchio (the turban) is emphasized by being cut at the right edge of the picture. The portrait can be compared with various portraits by Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, especially the bystanders in the scene of St Peter preaching. This comparison points to a date about 1426-27, making this panel the earliest surviving independent portrait in fifteenth-century Florence	MASACCIO	Profile of a Man	Tempera on wood, 41 x 30 cm	1426-27	portrait	Italian	1401-1450

He is dressed in medieval armour. The story, whose authenticity is debated, relates that the soldiers, at the instigation of Maurice, refused to participate in certain pagan rites. They were punished by the Emperor Maximian Herculeus first by decimation and finally by the wholesale massacre of the legion. Maurice and his fellow officers were executed in A.D. 287.According to another interpretation, the warrior saint is identified as St Secundus	STROZZI, Bernardo	St Maurice and the Angel	Oil on canvas, 82 x 101 cm	c. 1640	religious	Italian	1601-1650
23922-tavern.jpg	In the 1620s in Roman circles, a definite change came about in the subject matter of musical paintings. The representation of figures playing musical instruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's Lute Player and Musicians) disappeared. Within the space of a very few years they were replaced by large numbers of representations of concerts in public places and 'popular' locations. One of the earlier examples of this new trend is Bartolomeo Manfredi's Tavern Scene with a Lute Player. One characteristic of the painting, besides the presence of the lute player in a non-musical context (he simply accompanies a scene in which people are eating and drinking), is the absence of a musical score, an attribute of 'cultivated' musical painting.

17967-06monte1.jpg	"After completing the cycle of St Francis, Benozzo painted the first bay in the monastery church's southern side aisle, known as the Chapel of St Jerome. The main wall shows a painted polyptych, the Madonna and Child surrounded by Saints. This creates the illusion that it continues in the fresco painted above it, as if it were a realistic addition in front of the wall. The curtain and the shadows of the pinnacles and triangular gables make a considerable contribution to creating this impression. Benozzo's artistic capabilities here reached the highest level of illusion. It addition, it is remarkable that the artist ""placed"" the Gothic work within a classical framework which he signed OPUS BENOZII DE FLORENZIA.Above the polyptych Christ on the Cross can be seen surrounded by four angels who are catching the blood dripping from his wounds. On either side below him, St Dominic and St Francis are kneeling on the left side, and St Romuald and St Sylvester on the right. The walls show St Jerome in the desert and the martyrdom of St Sebastian. In the vault the four evangelists appear with their attributes: St Matthew with the angel, St Mark with the lion, St Luke with the ox and St John with the eagle.

18377-1704grec.jpg	There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions. He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition. The version in the Budapest museum is a good example of the vertical type. There are other vertical versions in Andújar, in Cuenca and in Buenos Aires. The intervention of El Greco's workshop can be assumed in all these paintings.In his religious compositions and portraits El Greco frequently repeated themes from his major works, with slight alterations, to meet different commissions. He broke away from the Renaissance tradition and ceased to depict reality and nature. In order to convey mystic emotions and to imbue his work with passion he distorted and elongated the forms and used stridently blazing colours to express the transcendental. The Agony in the Garden is such mystic interpretation representative of El Greco's late years and mature style.The painting depicts the last night of Christ on the Mount of Olives. In the foreground the tired pupils are sleeping, their unnaturally rigid robes refer to the wax models which the aged master used. Above them Christ is kneeling while an angel appears. The scene is a grassy clearing which looks like to be a lighted stage.

14954-tahiti01.jpg	Gauguin's Tahitian paintings celebrate the lushness and mysterious splendour of his new environment. At the same time they are seldom correct pictures of Tahitian life, from an anthropological standpoint, but rather feature recastings and recombinations of objects and persons taken out of their normal settings, as was the case with several of his paintings done in Brittany.The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau). In Ia Orana Maria Gauguin places the Christian story into a setting where both the figures and the vegetation are Polynesian. A Tahitian woman, her young son, and two women standing nearby are shown in the obvious attitudes of the Virgin and Child with attendant saints or worshiping angels.Once again Gauguin has returned to the theme of the effect of profound religious faith on an apparently simple people, which had preoccupied him in some of his most important Breton works. The apparently effortless fusion of Christian iconography with Tahitian subject matter is in fact carefully contrived, with the poses of the background figures lifted from the relief carving on the Javanese temple of Borobudur, photographs of which Gauguin had taken with him to Tahiti	GAUGUIN, Paul	Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary)	Oil on canvas, 114 x 88 cm	1891	religious	French	1851-1900
21307-09magdam.jpg	Around 1620 a group of young French painters developed interesting derivations from works by Caravaggio. Among these we find Georges de la Tour. In his canvases he adopted the strong light and shade contrasts characteristics of Caravaggio's school, although in his chiaroscuro effects he preferred the Nordic tenebrosi's use of artificial light, such as candles and torches, which produces a dazzling effect and creates a more transcendental atmosphere that does not include the supernatural.

17027-antwerp6.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 212, JH 999.This painting is in many ways the key Antwerp picture by van Gogh. He was mocking the procedure in drawing classes, where a skeleton invariably served as the basis of anatomical studies.

04123-peasants.jpg	Nicolaes Berchem, the son of a distinguished still-life painter, Pieter Claesz., was born in Haarlem. The town was a leading centre of landscape painting in the early seventeenth century and among Berchem's teachers was the landscapist Jan van Goyen. Like many Dutch artists, Berchem travelled to Italy immediately after completing his apprenticeship. He was in Rome late in 1642 and remained there for three years. While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes. As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments. These buildings cannot be identified, as they are only loosely modelled on actual ruins. Berchem uses a bright, highly-coloured palette and applies the paint in short, stabbing brush strokes.In seventeenth-century Holland there was a constant demand for exotic landscapes of this type and Berchem was a highly successful artist. He moved to Amsterdam, which had a larger art market than Haarlem, in about 1677. His work was widely imitated and copied during his lifetime and his paintings enthusiastically sought after in France in the eighteenth century and in England in the nineteenth. This painting, having been in the distinguished Amsterdam collection of Gerrit Braamcamp in the mid-eighteenth century, was bought in Paris by the Duc de Chabot in 1780 and in London in 1840 by Sir Robert Peel	BERCHEM, Nicolaes	Peasants with Cattle by a Ruined Aqueduct	Oil on wood, 47 x 39 cm	c. 1658	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

38716-girlhold.jpg	In addition to the paintings by Caravaggio, Terbrugghen was also inspired by Northern imagery from the sixteenth century and by the subject matter and figure style of his contemporary, Dirck van Baburen. The two artists probably shared a studio in Utrecht, and around 1620 both artists produced series of genre scenes with single figures - musicians, singers, smokers and drinkers. These genre scenes were often produced in pairs.Terbrugghen's figures have often been interpreted as allegories of the Five Senses. The present painting has been seen as interpreting Taste. It was only partly executed by Terbrugghen, the painting was completed by another, inferior hand in his workshop	TERBRUGGHEN, Hendrick	Girl Holding a Tankard and a Glass	Oil on canvas, 103 x 84 cm	1626	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
42435-scene1.jpg	Originally this panel formed part of a series of paintings consisting of five consecutive scenes, each accompanied by a saying (Poverty leads to Cunning; Cunning leads to Wealth; Wealth leads to Luxury; Luxury leads to Misery; and Misery leads to Death). Each scene shows two main figures walking, dancing or stumbling through a sketchily rendered landscape. In Poverty leads to Cunning they are two old, blind musicians, the man playing a hurdy-gurdy and the woman a rommelpot. The inscription is written on a curling banderole lying on the ground.These monochrome oil paintings on panel are universally referred to as grisailles although in this case it is actually in shades of brown (brunaille)	VENNE, Adriaen Pietersz. van de	"Armoe' Soeckt List (""Poverty Leads to Cunning"")"	Oil on panel, 37 x 31 cm	1630s	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
11548-hodigitr.jpg	The Greek word Hodigitria is a composite of two words: way and to lead, i.e. leading the way. According to one legend the icon was given this name after restoring sight to two blind men. Another legend relates that the icon was a talisman for the Greek emperors during their military campaigns. And the third legend states that originally the icon was in a church near a port where departing sailors used to pray before the icon asking the Mother of God to lead the way so they did not get lost in the seas	DIONYSIUS	The Mother of God Hodigitria	Egg tempera on panel	1502-03	religious	Russian	1451-1500

38632-bp_advic.jpg	"This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his ""Die Wahlverwandtschaften"" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs. Contrary to Vermeer's paintings, the dim light and the subdued chiaroscuro do not allow a forceful grasp of the whole field of vision. The light comes mostly from the front and stops at the glossy surfaces of the costumes and other textures"	TERBORCH, Gerard	Paternal Admonition (Gallant Conversation)	Oil on canvas, 71 x 73 cm	c. 1654	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
22803-carousel.jpg	Loir concentrated his oeuvre on scenes of the city.

10313-06woman1.jpg	This painting was executed by the workshop of Lucas Cranach. Cranach's productive workshop follows the master's example in presenting us with this bizarre and highly characterized portrait of a lady, achieved with a sinuous and undulating line.

30779-8study3.jpg	There are drawings related to the frescoes in the Collegio del Cambio that are so precise and delicate that earlier scholars felt them to be preliminary drawings by Perugino, but today they are considered to be workshop products reproduced for study purposes. Only a very few drawings are now generally recognized as genuine studies by Perugino himself, including one for the Cumaean Sibyl. Its impetuous, sketchlike style makes it clear that it was a design drawing	PERUGINO, Pietro	Cumaean Sibyl	Pen and ink on white paper, 203 x 86 mm	1497-1500	religious	Italian	1451-1500
15943-venus.jpg	Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter. The Sleeping Venus is a case in point. The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting. She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature. Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies. Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed. Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world. Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master. In the Sleeping Venus a significant share has been assumed for Titian, especially in the landscape, where on the right a cupid has been painted out. The outstretched figure, stocky in proportions, is usually considered to be by Giorgione. The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface. But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality. Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject. There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed. If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death	GIORGIONE	Sleeping Venus	Oil on canvas, 108 x 175 cm	c. 1510	mythological	Italian	1451-1500
17731-218goya.jpg	The old superstitious, heathen cult of Pan that was persecuted by the Church but which still persisted in the more remote corners of the country was the subject of Goya's attack in this painting. Among a group of fanatic and stupidly credulous women and witches sits a huge ram, demanding one of the children as sacrifice. On the ground lies the emaciated body of a child.

38424-2louis.jpg	Bertalan Székely was the most fastidious master of the style known as historicism. He harboured the idea of painting The Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second already during the years he spent in Transylvania following his studies in Vienna. After having clarified the role of each element of the composition, he painted the great work in 1860 in Munich, where he was studying under Piloty. Working out the structure and the accent of colours in detail was of prime importance for Székely.The last Hungarian king from the Jagello Dynasty, the young Louis II (1516-1526), was slain in the Battle of Mohács. His passing symbolizes the death of the nation and the beginning of the Turkish suzerainty which lasted 150 years. The gestures of respect for the dead as well as the white shroud, which contrast dramatically with the sombre atmosphere, work in unison to focus our attention on the tragic figure of the Hungarian king	SZÉKELY, Bertalan	Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second	Oil on canvas, 140 x 182 cm	1860	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

34948-5oberze4.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the third scene on the north wall: The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. The second scene includes a building on the right with a white wall made of ashlars. The same wall can be seen on the left-hand side of the adjoining scene, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, then suddenly stops. This is where the Sea of Galilee begins. Also visible is the boat which is soon to find itself in a storm. The white ashlar walls must therefore form part of the fortification of the city which reaches down to the harbour	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, German	The Storm on the Sea of Galilee	Fresco	c. 980	religious	German	0951-1000

The outlines are very sharply defined, and the movement of nerves and tendons observed down to the last detail. Antonio del Pollaiuolo worked at time when thorough studies of anatomy were being made, and he therefore renders the human body realistically in its moments of greatest emotional excitement.The dramatic force of the episode is expressed in the hero's grimace of fatigue and horror, but also his certainty of victory.

23993-6sebasti.jpg	In 15th-century Italian art, portrayals of St Sebastian offered the opportunity of depicting an idealized nude figure in a classical setting. Mantegna tied the saint to the column of a triumphal arch both to emphasize his heroism and at the same time to stress the precise historic setting. The triumphal arch stands in a courtyard closed off by a wall. Debris from statues and a fragment of bacchanalian relief lie around, indicating the fall of the pagans and the victory of Christianity.A bearded horseman can be seen in the cloud to the left. Images in the cloud like this, already described in classical art theory and adopted by Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci, were ascribed to the genius of nature, which could stimulate artists and inspire them to improve on nature with their creations.The vertical inscription at the right side of the saint is the signature of Mantegna in Greek	MANTEGNA, Andrea	St Sebastian	Tempera on wood, 68 x 30 cm	1459	religious	Italian	1451-1500

13143-glorific.jpg	"The cross as the focal point of the ""gloria del paradiso"" is revered by the saints and the elect of the heavenly realm who surround the cross on banks of clouds. On the right, we recognize the patriarchs, including Moses, Abraham and King David. We also see Jonas sitting on the fish, looking up towards the cross, and St Catherine and Mary Magdalene in a sisterly embrace. In the foreground, there is a disputation between St Sebastian and Pope Gregory, St Jerome, St Ambrose and St Augustine, with the first Christian martyrs St Stephen and St Laurence. The cross, clutched by a kneeling female figure who is probably an embodiment of Faith, is surrounded by angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, above which we can make out the Evangelists and Apostles. At the head of a procession of angels streaming into the dazzling light of the background, which is flooded with an overwhelming brightness, we can see the Coronation of the Virgin.Elsheimer's unique art is evident in the astonishing illusion of remarkable breadth and depth achieved by this small panel painting. Here, space is no longer simply a problem of continuously reduced scale, but also one of simultaneous graduation of colour and the distribution of light and darkness. This creates interlocking areas of colour and light which, though perceived by the eye, nevertheless take on the quality of a vision.

The Scenes of the Life of St Benedict in the predella, with their fairy tale charm, are to be reckoned among the highest achievements of the master.Lorenzo's elegant style reached maturity in this very large altarpiece.In this painting the edges of the figures' garments have an animation quite independent of the actual movement of the figures. Although the composition of the painting is quite conventional, the figures display a new fluidity in their poses and in the movements of their drapery which is suggestive of the International Style then being employed in sculpture by Ghiberti and Niccol&#242; Lamberti. Surface patterns vie for attention with the volumes of the figures; even the superimposition of figures tends to read as pattern. Brilliant, light-toned colour and the lavish use of gold and expensive ultramarine blue pigment would have made the painting a strong focal point in the church and would also have testified to its importance and to the donor's extraordinary generosity	LORENZO Monaco	The Coronation of the Virgin	Tempera on wood, 450 x 350 cm	1414	religious	Italian	1401-1450
10154-49religi.jpg	The representation of Christ's head in this painting is based on the 'vera icon', the true face of Christ. According to the legend, this likeness appeared in a miraculous way on St Veronica's veil after she had used it to wipe the blood and sweat from the Lord on the Road to Calvary. The vera icon was a favourite subject of paintings and graphic works in the late Middle Ages.The type of image derives from Early Netherlandish painting (Jan van Eyck and Dieric Bouts the Elder)	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Christ's Head with Crown of Thorns	Oil and tempera on limewood, 28 x 21 cm	1520-25	religious	German	1501-1550

04559-yosemite.jpg	Albert Bierstadt, a native of Germany, stood in the tradition of the Hudson River School, founded by the English-born Thomas Cole, which marked the beginning of a genuinely American landscape painting. He discovered the American wilderness for art, applying these means in the tradition of Claude Lorrain. In 1863, Bierstadt and the writer Fritz Hugh Ludlow set off on an expedition to the Wild West, which took them thousands of miles through the dramatic scenery of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, and Oregon. The artist captured these impressions in a series of large-format panoramas that made him the founder of the Rocky Mountain School.Yosemite Valley at Sunset was a preliminary study for one of these large paintings. As dramatic as the area is in reality, Bierstadt heightened it still further, plunging the scene into a veritably mythical illumination. Bierstadt's views and the stereoscopic photographs his two brothers made of the Yosemite Mountains contributed to the declaration of the area as a national park	BIERSTADT, Albert	Yosemite Valley at Sunset	Oil on cardboard, 30 x 49 cm	1864	landscape	American	1851-1900
14560-06macbet.jpg	Fuseli was the second son of the Zurich portraitist and author Johann Caspar Fussli. His early contact with the teachings of Johann Jakob Bodmer familiarized him with the figures of world literature, which were to remain a major source of inspiration throughout his career. Ordained in 1761 as a pastor in the Zwinglian Reformed Church, he left Zurich two years later for political reasons, traveling by way of Berlin to London, where he settled. Initially Fuseli made his living by writing, while engaged in illustrating the works of his favourite authors, particularly William Shakespeare.The painting represents a scene from Shakespeare's Macbeth. It shows Lady Macbeth as a a sleep-walker in the corridor of a fortress. The terrified eyes of Lady Macbeth, by now lost between reality and nightmare, clutch at the viewer, almost as though trying to capture him and carry him off into her own unknown dimension	FUSELI, John Henry	Lady Macbeth	Oil on canvas, 221 x 160 cm	1784	other	Swiss	1751-1800
33484-02histor.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 468.The subject of the painting is debated. Some of the critics thinks it represents Artemisia taking the ashes of Mausolos, while others assume it shows Sophonisba taking the cup of poison. In any cases, it is a representation of matrimonial love therefore it is assumed that the painting depicts Saskia, the wife of the artist.Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory. In Renaissance painting she is depicted holding a cup or goblet	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Artemisia	Oil on canvas, 142 x 152 cm	1634	historical	Dutch	1601-1650
20890-port_you.jpg	Even at the age of eleven, Angelica Kauffmann earned admiring praise for her portrait of Bishop Nevroni and although she would later concentrate on allegorical, antique, historical and religious themes in her paintings, the portrait was to remain the driving force behind her success throughout her life. She received so many commissions that her painting tended to become rather routine, taking on an increasing smoothness and superficial appeal at the expense of a more distinctive style. This Portrait of a Young Woman also has something routine about it, and is as pleasingly decorative as any interior decor that she might have created in her frequent collaboration with the English architect Robert Adam. Nevertheless, it does show a face as that of a highly sensitive personality	KAUFFMANN, Angelica	Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil on canvas, 130 x 102 cm	1781	portrait	Swiss	1751-1800
26106-28jerome.jpg	The legend of this fourth-century doctor of the Church only began to take shape in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting. Small, transparent droplets of blood well up from his bruised chest. His scarlet cardinal's cloak and hat lie on the ground behind him, as if he had just cast them off. The lion lies down faithfully beside him. The scene is enacted on a rocky plateau before a cave, which is the hermit's retreat.This fairly large panel is not very well known, and is sometimes treated with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, it is a fine example in every respect of Memling's vision and technique. Monumentally conceived, yet executed with an undramatically fresh and guileless realism, this St Jerome is one of the most elegant large figures in the artist's oeuvre. The spatial character of the slim, half-naked saint is comparable with the Stuttgart Bathsheba. The extremely free underdrawing, the elongated body shapes and a physiognomy that seems to prefigure that of Van Cleve or Massys suggest that both paintings were executed fairly late, although additional evidence would be required for more precise dating. A characteristic Memling trait is the way the emblematic attributes such as the crucifix, the lion and the cardinal's clothes are included in a natural manner. Taken together, it is like a moment from a story, despite the fact that the depicted elements refer to different periods of the saint's life. Furthermore, the crucifix consists of a genuine flesh-and-blood little body, put to death in miniature, with no attempt on the artist's part to portray it as a vision.We do not know whether the panel was autonomous, or whether it had wings or a companion piece. The small fragment depicting St Jerome and the Lion might have formed part of the left wing (private collection)	MEMLING, Hans	St Jerome	Oil on oak panel, 87,8 x 59,2 cm	1485-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
30937-stillif1.jpg	The drawings of fruits, vegetables and flowers, done in oil on prepared paper, are part of an extraordinary cache of drawings acquired by the Musei Civici of Milan in 1924 from the local church of Santa Maria presso San Celso. They were attributed to the workshop of Simone Peterzano, because many of the drawings in the group are demonstrably by him, and because in subject matter they seemed appropriate to the activity of the workshop. However, the more than two thousand five hundred drawings are enormously varied in style and date. Approximately one thousand have had a traditional association with Peterzano's workshop. There is no direct evidence that this sheet came from that section comprised of work by Peterzano and his students	PETERZANO, Simone	Peapods and Cherries	Oil on prepared paper, 16 x 15 cm	-	study	Italian	1551-1600
18747-guard213.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself.	GUARDI, Francesco	The Coronation of the Doge	Oil on canvas, 66 x 101 cm	1766-70	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

00370-5battle.jpg	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.

23540-2hunyadi.jpg	"From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, Hungarian painters began to paint historical scenes as well as landscapes, portraits and genre paintings. It was not merely a fashion in Hungary to follow the current Romantic Movement that originated in Paris, or the ""historism"" of the Munich and Vienna Academies; it went much deeper than that. At the defeat of the fight for independence, the nation escaped into its history. Along with Hungarian poets and writers, the painters recalled the glorious events of the past, searching for ideals of patriotism and heroism that had not been crushed by despotism.Viktor Madarász gained the first international appreciation for Hungarian painting when his picture, ""The Bewailing of László Hunyadi"" won the State Grand Prix at the 1861 Paris Salon Exhibition. This rather romantic historical painting of the Hunyadi tragedy epitomizes the national grief of the 1850s, and fans the fire of revenge. The dead body of the heroic László Hunyadi, son of the great János Hunyadi, lies in Buda Castle Chapel. King László V, fearing for throne, had lured the popular young Hunyadi to his place with a promise of safe passage. Then he seized him and had him beheaded in the market place at Buda on March 16, 1457.

14906-early08.jpg	By 1883, and as a direct result of the collapse of the stock market the previous year, Gauguin's finances were in disarray, and he began to consider a change in career. This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.The subject of a snowy landscape was a typical Impressionist device to enable the artist to study the effects of colour reflections on a white surface and was particularly favoured by Sisley. However, the handling in the sky and the foliage is more reminiscent of the work of Monet from this period. The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting. This means that the two women were added later, and demonstrates that even at this date Gauguin did not feel tied to working solely from nature, and had already begun to use the subject of two conversing women which was to recur in his mature work	GAUGUIN, Paul	The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel	Oil on canvas, 117 x 90 cm	1883	landscape	French	1851-1900

00195-5verospi.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was the loggia of the Villa Farnesina, painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese, from Reni's Aurora and Guercino's Aurora are also present	ALBANI, Francesco	Ceiling vault of piano nobile loggia	Fresco	1611-12	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

00957-03prede2.jpg	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes	ANGELICO, Fra	The Naming of St John the Baptist	Tempera and gold on panel, 26 x 24 cm	1434-35	religious	Italian	1401-1450
25051-double1.jpg	This double-sided panel once formed the wing of a now lost altarpiece, with the Adoration of the Magi originally serving as the interior panel and the Throne of Grace as the exterior. Formerly, the panel was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The style of this master and his workshop was greatly influenced by Flemish painters, in particular, Hugo van der Goes, whose Monforte Altarpiece may be seen as a direct inspiration for the individual figures in this work (particularly the second kneeling King in the Adoration). Furthermore, the picture is indicative of the influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on the group of Cologne painters working at the turn of the 16th century. Such influence on the present work can be seen in Rogier's Columba Altarpiece, which utilizes a similar spatial construction and figural arrangement found in the Adoration here	MASTER of the Holy Kinship	The Adoration of the Magi	Oil on panel, 116 x 86 cm	1510s	religious	German	1501-1550

26143-37frag1.jpg	A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman.

19818-portrai1.jpg	The two panels in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, representing the portraits of a man and a woman, reveal the artist's interest in depicting the physical characteristics of his sitters, both of whom have rather pronounced features. Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife. However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned. It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses	HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on panel, 24 x 17 cm	1518-20	portrait	German	1451-1500
23076-3washin.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church.In this scene the painter makes skillful use of the obstacle represented by the arch on the wall to produce a scene split into two levels. The lively dialog between Christ and the apostle conveys a sense of movement that embrace all the other figures	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Washing of the Feet	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350
41411-18chape1.jpg	The two frescoes (Crucifixion and The Virgin and Donor) from the oratory of Mocchirolo constitute one of the most interesting and complete examples of the spreading influence of Tuscan art in northern Italy during the late fourteenth century. Count Porro, who commissioned the decoration of the oratory, is shown kneeling before the Madonna in The Virgin and Donor. Controlled and contained in feeling, the dramatic aspects of the tragedy of the Crucifixion are expressed in the noble pathos of the swooning Madonna. To maintain the equilibrium of the composition, the outward movement of her body is countered by the angels in flight and the columnar figure of St John.The modeling of the figures, achieved through gradations of intense colour, complements the measured narrative rhythm. In the portraits of the donors (members of the Porro family) on the walls, and in the figure of St Catherine, the drawing is light and precise. In both paintings the roseate colour is laid on in thin, transparent brushstrokes, and the tenuous compositional connections have an elegant subtlety	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Crucifixion	Detached fresco, 378 x 277 cm	1370	religious	Italian	1351-1400

26248-magdalen.jpg	Anton Raphael Mengs painted this picture in 1752 in Rome, and it led to his admittance to the Accademia di San Luca. Later he tackled the subject on numerous occasions, and in very different ways. In this version elegance and an expression of great sensitivity are combined with reminiscences of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century painting, along with echoes of Classicism in the drapery and the landscape.The depiction of Mary Magdalene as a penitent does not appear in the Bible. It was not until the twelfth century that the legend arose of how she withdrew to a cave in Sainte-Baume in Provence in order to do penance after a life of sin	MENGS, Anton Raphael	The Penitent Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 48 x 64 cm	1752	religious	German	1751-1800
32083-underbru.jpg	Along with Giuseppe Recco and Giovan Battista Ruoppolo, Paolo Porpora was one of the leading figures in Neapolitan still-life painting during the Baroque. In his first period in Naples he painted fish and kitchen still-lifes in great variety. In the late 1640s he moved to Rome and, after coming into contact with the Northern European masters Matthias Withoos and Otto Marseus van Schrieck, active in the city at that time, he began to produce his famous underbrush paintings. The painting in Nancy is one of the few examples of these works that remained	PORPORA, Paolo	Underbrush with Tortoise and Crab	Oil on canvas, 61 x 76 cm	1650-55	portrait	Italian	1651-1700
19902-01henry8.jpg	Henry VIII (1491-1547), king of England (1509-47), who presided over the beginnings of the English Renaissance and the English Reformation. His six wives were, successively, Catherine of Aragon (the mother of the future queen Mary I), Anne Boleyn (the mother of the future queen Elizabeth I), Jane Seymour (the mother of Henry's successor, Edward VI), Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr.This portrait is the only surviving individual portrait of Henry that Holbein himself painted. In terms of features, it corresponds largely to the figure in the Whitehall cartoon. Both portraits are likely to have been based on a single, now lost portrait study by Holbein. However, as a consequence of the small format of the panel painting, the heavy shoulder chain that the king wears in the monumental portrait is omitted here, and his sleeves are embroidered with a very delicate gold thread.This is the quintessential image of the overbearing and tyrannous monarch, from the year the dissolution of the monasteries (and the consequent appropriation of their wealth for the Crown and its servants) was instigated. Holbein depicts the King at `face value', without flattery, emphasizing the small, humourless eyes and mouth, the curiously flat cheeks and chin. Henry's bulky and capricious authority haunts the work despite its small size. Its condensation of magnificence run riot here takes the form of real gold used in the chain, jewellery and collar.The portrait is undoubtedly a tour de force; after its execution, Holbein's position at the court seems to have been secure, and he was used as a painter-ambassador when the King's marital plans unraveled in the late 1530s. Only his misleading portrayal of Anne of Cleves would check his popularity.The subsequent spawning of similar but less effective portraits of the king by Holbein's followers has tended to obscure the compelling mixture of simplicity and realism displayed in this design - the tilt and curve of the black and white hat, the fearful symmetry of the jewelled jacket and the modelling of the hands: imitators often managed either simplicity or realism but never both.

37795-3east1.jpg	The picture shows two scenes in the upper register of the east wall. Scene 7 (left) depicts when St Benedict departs the monastery of Vicovaro. Benedict explains to the monks that his way of life is not compatible with theirs, and he leaves them to return to Subiaco.Scene 8 (right) depicts when St Benedict accepts Maurus and Placidus as disciples. More and more followers gather around Benedict and he is soon able to establish twelve monasteries, but also to keep disciples with him for better instruction in the spiritual life. Maurus and Placidus are two such disciples, both of whom come from distinguished Roman families	SPINELLO ARETINO	Two scenes on the east wall	Fresco	1388	religious	Italian	1351-1400
03287-1assunta.jpg	Around 1475, Bartolomeo della Gatta painted this picture for the Benedictine Church of the Contesse in Cortona. It can be considered his masterpiece because it reaches a degree of lyricism only achieved previously by Piero della Francesca.The painting was moved into the Church of St Dominic in 1788 where the Servants of Mary, who used to run the church, repainted the two Benedictine saints in the foreground, St Benedict and St Scolastica, transforming them into Filippo Benizzi and Giuliana Falconeri, two saints of their religious order. recent restoration has returned the painting to its original beauty and has also removed a group of angels added in the eighteenth century	BARTOLOMEO DELLA GATTA	The Lady of the Assumption Gives St Thomas Her Belt	Tempera on panel, 317 x 221 cm	c. 1475	religious	Italian	1451-1500

17299-selfpo26.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 522, JH 1356.Shortly before he left Paris and moved to Provence in late February 1888, van Gogh painted this final self-portrait. He is no longer dressed as the urban dandy, but in the blue blouson of the Parisian working class. He stands before his easel, holding his palette in a pose intentionally reminiscent of a self-portrait by Rembrandt which was then in the Louvre and well known to van Gogh. Perhaps the painting should be read as a kind of manifesto of the new orientation in his conception of himself as an artist and of his work - the intention to remove himself from the city and its bourgeois lifestyle, and the desire to be seen in a Dutch rather than a French tradition. The painting also betrays a growing confidence in himself as an artist: he appears with the insignia of his profession. Greater assurance is also evident in the handling. The earlier extreme experimentation with pure or broken colour and a textured and structuring brushwork has given way to a more controlled and coherent treatment. In the pose he has used, van Gogh evokes Rembrandt; but the painterly treatment and coloration remind us of another seventeenth-century Dutch artist - Frans Hals. The lessons van Gogh had learnt in Antwerp, explored in greater depth throughout the Paris period, are now successfully integrated into his work to produce a distinctive style	GOGH, Vincent van	Self-Portrait in front of the Easel	Oil on canvas, 65 x 51 cm	January 1888, Paris	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
24767-c_thief.jpg	In his Nativity the Master of Flémalle (Robert Campin) proved himself a sensitive painter of landscape, who knew how to portray the atmospheric subtleties of light and air; but he does not always use nature as the background for his compositions. In the Crucified Thief, the one surviving panel of a lost altarpiece, he resorts to the archaic device of a gold background, contrasting its abstraction with the marked individuality of the figures. The thief's face is contorted with pain, and the wounds where the cords have cut into the flesh are rendered in an extraordinarily brutal manner. The Roman soldiers looking on, particularly the one whose curly hair is held back by a white band and who is placing one hand on his heart, are portrayed with a realism that was at that time outstanding	MASTER of Flémalle	The Crucified Thief	Oil on wood, 33 x 92,5 cm	c. 1410	religious	Flemish	1401-1450
23811-4olympi1.jpg	This canvas was the most vociferously decried painting of the 1865 Salon. In fact, Manet has painted it in 1863 but had apparently not dared submit it in 1864. Olympia is another painting packed with allusions to past masterpieces, notably Titian's Venus of Urbino and Goya's Naked Maja. This whole tradition, from the odalisque to the black slave, continues (particularly with Ingres) throughout the nineteenth century, but what was surprising here was the absence of any exoticism, of either period or location, and the portrayal of a modern prostitute.The painting of the period was not at all averse to flowers, and Courbet, Fantin-Latour, and Manet all painted many pictures with flowers in them. Among the best known bunches (this time wrapped in florist's paper, like those that later Degas placed in the hands of his dancers as they took their bow) is the one being presented by a black servant to Olympia	MANET, Edouard	Olympia	Oil on canvas, 131 x 190 cm	1863	portrait	French	1851-1900

17002-nuenen17.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 158, JH 792.Van Gogh showed, in several drawings and paintings, women absorbed in work in the solitude of their homes. Sewing, spooling thread, peeling potatoes, shelling beans and preparing food were among the most frequently depicted subjects. During the day, light shone into the dark rooms through the windows, whereas lamp- or firelight illuminated the models in the evening.In the present painting the woman sitting to the right of the fire is peeling a potato. A kettle is boiling over the fire, hanging from a chain barely visible in the curling smoke.Van Gogh's Nuenen interiors of peasant women engaged in their work convey a certain timelessness and reflect the influence of 17th-century Dutch genre painting	GOGH, Vincent van	Peasant Woman by the Fireplace	Oil on canvas on panel, 29 x 40 cm	March-April 1885, Nuenen	genre	Dutch	1851-1900
11156-1870s_18.jpg	Horse racing, a sport imported from England, was a novelty at that time. Degas discovered racetracks as a subject for art in the early 1860s. However, he rarely painted the course itself, he preferred to look elsewhere. He was fascinated by preparations for a race, by false starts and the wait before the start, by the tension and the release of tension - all of them moments hardly laden with action	DEGAS, Edgar	Racehorses in Longchamps	Oil on canvas, 34 x 42 cm	c. 1874	other	French	1851-1900

04735-adoratio.jpg	The Catholic painter Abraham, resident in predominantly Catholic Utrecht, painted spectacular altarpieces in the style reminiscent of sixteenth-century Italian painting. He painted this altarpiece, one of his largest, for the church of the Catholic order of the Jesuits in Brussels, in the Southern Netherlands. Such commissions were extremely rare in the Dutch Republic.

03387-stillmus.jpg	"Because he was in holy orders, Baschenis is sometimes referred to as Father Evaristo. The Bergamese Baschenis was, more than anything else, the perfect example of a ""specialist"" painter. In fact nearly all his oeuvre was dedicated to painting musical instruments, sometimes his pictures being finished by other painters who added figures (as in the case of two paintings that have recently been found in the Brera in Milan). From this specific point of view, Baschenis is one of the most fascinating and focused painters of the whole of the seventeenth century. His use of realism and light is reminiscent of Caravaggio. His canvases had an intense quality which was dominated by his exceptional technical ability (one thing that stands out is the way in which he depicted dust on the back of stringed instruments).But Baschenis' work never degenerated into a mere display of virtuoso talent. It was rather directed to convey a sense of almost severe moral purpose. Baschenis' success with still-life gave rise, especially in Bergamo itself, to a real fashion for the genre, with other painters following his example."

18777-guard400.jpg	This painting is a view of the Campo San Zanipolo with the loggia temporarily erected outside the Scuola di San Marco for the benediction of Pope Pius VI on 19 May 1782.In May 1782, Pope Pius VI visited the city of Venice. The ceremonies and festivities on that occasion were recorded by Francesco Guardi in a series of four paintings. The city council commissioned Guardi to make four paintings representing the following subjects: the arrival of the pontiff near San Giorgio in Alga, the papal mass in SS Giovanni e Paolo, the papal audience and the blessing of the people on Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo.On the occasion of the Pope Pius VI blessing the crowd a temporary wooden loggia, designed by Antonio Codognato, was erected on the façade of the Scuola di San Marco. Once the Pope had finished his blessing the crowds were allowed to mount the loggia and the existence of at least three variants of this subject, including the present one, attest to the popularity of the composition	GUARDI, Francesco	View of the Campo San Zanipolo in Venice	Oil on canvas, 62 x 47 cm	1782	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

35578-23gevart.jpg	"This is a portrait of Rubens' friend Jan Gaspar Gevaerts (1593-1666). He was a reputable philologist, Neo-Latin poet and historiographer. Characteristically for his intellectual circles he had his name Latinized to Gevartius.After a stay in Holland and Paris Gevartius became the Registrar of the city of Antwerp. In this function he was in charge of official ceremonies in the city and in 1635 helped Rubens with the ""Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi"", one of Rubens most impressive projects.Rubens here intends to represent his friend's humanist attitude: he is sitting at his desk, with a bust of the Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, on whom he wrote an unpublished commentary. The painting is dated around 1628.

08303-pitti.jpg	The picture shows the south wall of the Salone Terreno (Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) on the ground floor of the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule.

13722-marthama.jpg	In composition and overall approach to subject matter Giovanni Andrea appears to have been influenced by Caravaggio's canvas of the same subject. However, while Caravaggio's composition is underpinned by a complex visual and literal tradition associated with this subject, Giovanni Andrea's interpretation appears to be more closely associated with allegorical genre scenes by Venetian masters, such as Titian or Palma Vecchio. Such influence could only have been transmuted into Giovanni Andrea's work through his most influential master, Bernardo Strozzi.

05533-51lemmi.jpg	The only secular frescoes by Botticelli that still exist were discovered 1873, in the Villa Lemmi, at the foot of the Careggi Hill, close to a villa of Cosimo de Medici. They had been concealed under old coats of paint for centuries. Villa Lemmi belonged to the Tornabuoni family, friend of the Medici. It is possible that the frescoes were commissioned on the occasion of a marriage between members of the Tornabuoni and Albizzi families. For a long time the view was held that the couple in question were Giovanna degli Albizzi and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who married in 1486. This assumption has, however, since been proven wrong, for the face of Giovanna that we know from a medallion does not agree with the lady in Botticell's fresco. A possible alternative could be Nanna Tornabuoni and Matteo degli Albizzi, who married in about 1484.It is supposed the frescoes were executed to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi.The frescoes are in a very poor state of preservation, because they were damaged when taken down from the wall. Two of the three fragments found were transferred to canvas and later sold to the Louvre in Paris. The two compositions were originally separated only by a window.One of the fragments probably  represents Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, the other A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts.On this painting there is a strange lack of certainty as to the identity of the group of four young classically dressed women, who are gracefully stepping towards a young woman in front of the splashing spring in order to bring her gifts. They may be Venus and the Three Graces, symbolizing chastity, beauty and love	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman	Fresco transferred to canvas, 211 x 284 cm	c. 1484	mythological	Italian	1451-1500

12957-armour.jpg	During his extended stay in Italy from 1621 to 1627, spending the majority of his time in Genoa, Van Dyck made his mark as a portraitist, and numbered many important families from the upper strata of Genoese society among his clients. It has yet to be clarified whether or not the Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf was one of these commissions; various attempts to identify the man in the picture have been inconclusive. It is also possible that the painting is not a portrait but an allegory	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf	Oil on canvas, 90 x 70 cm	1625-27	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

11273-207delac.jpg	Delacroix's grandest pictures have never left their country of origin. Only in Paris can we fully appreciate the bold reconciliation of beauty with cruelty, sensuality with control, fantasy with observation, modernity with tradition that characterises the art of this influential painter.'As Byron signifies Romantic poetry, so Romantic French art means above all Delacroix. Like Byron he achieved his flamboyant artistic effects through intense intellectual application and a firm grasp of technique. Pupil of an academic artist, he was essentially self-taught through the study of the great Renaissance and seventeenth-century colourists in the Louvre. He was fascinated by the vibrant brushwork of the Venetians and their Flemish heir Rubens, imitating their capacity to simulate brilliant daylight even in the shadows, their use of colour instead of line as the primary structural element. It was precisely these effects which, as employed by Constable in the Hay-Wain exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1824, caused a sensation and further exacerbated Delacroix's fashionable Anglomania. In 1825, having sold his picture of the Massacre of Chios to the French State, he set out for London with two English friends, the watercolourists Richard Bonington and Thales Fielding. They visited galleries and the theatre and read English poets. Delacroix met other English artists, including Thomas Lawrence. Appropriately for a painting in an English collection, the lifesize likeness of Louis-Auguste Schwiter, painted after Delacroix's return to Paris, is an essay in the portrait style of Lawrence.Schwiter, a lifelong friend of Delacroix, was himself a painter. He is presented here, however, as a gentleman, dressed in elegant black and hat in hand, standing on what appears to be the terrace of a great country house, as if waiting to be admitted. The blue Chinese vase with its heavily paint-textured flowers contrasts with the red lining of his hat. Like the trumpet vine clippings on the paving, these touches of colour serve to relate the foreground to the brooding sunset landscape (said to have been painted in part by Paul Huet, another artist friend), thus counteracting the isolation of Schwiter's monochrome silhouette.The portrait is lit from the right, a reversal of the more usual illumination from the left, highlighting the left side of the sitter's face and perhaps helping to account for the curiously tentative impression he gives, despite his firm stance in the centre of the picture and his direct gaze. The unemphatic 'modern' pose, with its hint of English-style reserve, and the free 'unfinished' brushwork made this full-length portrait, at once so formal and so unconventional, unacceptable to the judges of the 1827 Paris Salon exhibition, and it was rejected. Delacroix later reworked the painting, finally completing it in 1830	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	Louis-Auguste Schwiter	Oil on canvas, 218 x 144 cm	1826-27	portrait	French	1801-1850
36111-hercules.jpg	With such paintings as painted tapestry, painting within a painting it became possible to use the flat surface of a ceiling vault for narrative depictions. Given a corresponding design of the fictive architecture of a vault structure it became possible to combine an illusory extension of the room upward with an outward extension.

42748-buff1.jpg	"Blindman's buff is a children's game played as early as 2,000 years ago in Greece. To play the standard game of blindman's buff, one player is blindfolded and then disoriented by being spun around several times. The other players, who are not blindfolded, amuse themselves by calling out to the ""blind man"" and dodging away from him. In the Middle Ages blindman's buff was an adult game, and the blindfolded player was usually struck and buffeted as well, hence ""buff.""

34842-traveler.jpg	It is said that this Dutch painter in Amsterdam was the friend of Rembrandt. His rocky mountainous landscapes show affinities with Rembrandt as well as traces of the work of his mother's uncle, the Mannerist Roelandt Savery. In 1646-47, when Roghman was nineteen- or twenty-years-old he drew a set of more than 240 large views of Dutch castles, presumably to fulfill a commission. This remarkable set of careful topographical drawings, now widely scattered, has nothing in common with Rembrandt's style. Later, in the 1660s, he was influenced by the topographical scenes produced by Allaert van Everdingen during his trips to Scandinavia	ROGHMAN, Roelandt	Valley with Travellers	Oil on canvas	1660s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
13024-stuarts.jpg	Early in 1639 the two Stuart brothers, cousins of King Charles I and younger sons of the third Duke of Lennox, set off on a three-year tour of the Continent. They must have posed for Van Dyck just before their departure. Since his arrival at the court, the artist had developed a new portrait type: the double portrait recording friendship, often, but not necessarily, between relatives. The two brothers are shown as if poised on the point of departure, waiting perhaps for servants to bring up their carriage. Both were to die a few years later in the Civil War, and hindsight gives the image an added valedictory poignancy.Van Dyck's compositional skill is surpassed only by his matchless ability to depict satin, lace and meltingly-soft kid leather. But these carefully described effects are somehow not local: the whole surface of the canvas is brought alive with a flickering touch. The costumes, so fashionably similar, are beautifully contrasted - receding warm gold and brown on Lord John, cooler and advancing silver and blue on Lord Bernard - so that the two brothers, complementing each other in apparel, seem to form one shimmering, indivisible whole	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Lord John and Lord Bernard Stuart	Oil on canvas, 238 x 146 cm	c. 1638	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
07499-271y_ram.jpg	This painting exists in two versions, both of which are probably by Caravaggio (who frequently copied his own paintings). Both versions are in Rome, the other in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.The image is a masterpiece of virtuosity whose appeal lies in its soft, caressing light and velvety rendering of cloth, flesh, and plants. The figure is identifiable as St John only virtue of the symbols of Christ displayed in the painting: the ram (sacrificial victim), and the grape-leaves (from whose red juice, akin to the blood of Christ, springs life); otherwise the iconographical subject (the simple, immediately apparent image) appears as a nude youth with an ironic, if not allusive, expression. Its cultivated content and its destination for an aristocratic patron are underscored by the artist's explicit use of a great figurative source of the past: Michelangelo's Ignudi from the Sistine Ceiling. But whereas Michelangelo created abstract and ideal figures with cold lights and a merely theoretical plasticism, Caravaggio models his figure on the careful observation of nature, achieving an image of perfect realism	CARAVAGGIO	St John the Baptist (Youth with Ram)	Oil on canvas, 129 x 94 cm	1602	religious	Italian	1551-1600
13770-hero_lea.jpg	According to legend, Leander, a youth of Abydos, a town on the Asian shore of the Hellespont, used to swim across the waters at night to Sestos on the opposite side to meet his lover Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite. She would guide him by holding up a lighted torch. One stormy night Leander was drowned. Hero in her despair threw herself into the sea. The story is related in this form by the Greek poet Museus (4th-5th cent. A.D.). Ovid tells of the lovers, omitting their death. The theme is found in Italian and Netherlandish painting, especially of the 17th century: the drowned Oleander is borne away by Needs as Hero plunges to her death into the sea	FETTI, Domenico	Hero and Leander	Oil on wood, 42 x 96 cm	1622-23	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
18745-guard211.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself	GUARDI, Francesco	The Doge at the Basilica of La Salute	Oil on canvas, 68 x 100 cm	1766-70	landscape	Italian	1751-1800
00813-marco_p3.jpg	This picture is the second from the left on the predella.In this scene the saints' prayer to God, the judge's attack by demons and their salvation by angels are represented in varied scale throughout the landscape to connote different moments in time. The undulating forms of the landscape recede and flatten as they approach the horizon, itself dissolved in the mist of atmospheric perspective.

08796-dry_tree.jpg	This small panel is a puzzling composition which conceals a complex symbolism. The painting is a late work by Christus, who from 1462 was a member of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Dry Tree. The dry and thorny branches could be a prefiguration of the Crown of Thorns, but the painting has also been interpreted as an early representation of the Immaculate Conception.

In each of the known versions, an adolescent boy leans on a window ledge  fringed with vines and blows through a straw, intensely concentrating on the large soap bubble at its tip. A young child strains over the ledge to watch.An engraving of the Soap Bubbles, published in 1739, matches none of the three extant paintings precisely.

42315-1006vela.jpg	At the end of the 1640s Velázquez was on the threshold to his late work and the peak of his artistic achievement, to which his likenesses of the Spanish Habsburgs, not least, made a considerable contribution. They are among the finest examples of court portraiture ever painted. This picture represents Infanta Margarita, born on 12 July 1651, daughter of Philip IV and his second wife, Mariana. The Infanta is the central figure of Velázquez's famous composition, Las Meninas, painted three years later	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Infanta Margarita	Oil on canvas, 128,5 x 100 cm	c. 1654	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

The predella paintings are copies, the originals are in the Musée du Louvre and in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Tours.Despite the framing elements that divide them, the three main panels of the San Zeno Altarpiece form an unified picture space. The central section depicts the Madonna holding her Child and surrounded by music-making angels, seated on a marble throne decorated with Roman-inspired reliefs. The naturalistic trompe l'oeil garlands, seemingly affixed to the top of the picture, create a rapport with the garlands held by the putti in the marble relief at the top of the throne. The borderline between the real world and the invented world here breaks down completely	MANTEGNA, Andrea	San Zeno Polyptych	Tempera on panel, 480 x 450 cm	1457-60	religious	Italian	1451-1500
26350-portarti.jpg	Dressed in their finery the couple sit side by side in a room, which is revealed by numerous items and the woman at the blackboard to be in a tavern. The man and his wife are illuminated by an unseen light source from the front left. The man is laughing and puts his left arm around the young woman's shoulders, a gesture echoed by her arm as she hands him some berries. He raises a flute glass in his right hand to her health, while she looks straight ahead rather stiffly. Beside the couple a table is laid with a silver pot, some dried fish and a small loaf of bread, but the way it has been truncated at one end gives it the look of a stage prop. The rear of the tavern is in shadow, so that all that may be distinguished is the incidental figure chalking up orders in front of the fireplace, a narrow shelf, and an empty birdcage hanging above. The room opens up to the rear at the right, giving a view of a sunny courtyard in which a market stall has been erected.Although the painting was for many years known simply as The Lovers at Breakfast, the two protagonists, quite different in type, have been identified as the artist and Isabella de Wolff, whom he married in 1658 and who was a niece of the painter Pieter de Grebber.The iconography of the painting distinguishes it as part of a painting tradition well-known to the educated contemporary viewer: the carousing, feasting couple, the ambience of the tavern with the landlady at the blackboard, the highly significant bread and fish still-life on the table. All of these elements point to the subject of the 'prodigal son regaling with the harlots in the inn'. This Biblical parable, much loved and widespread in seventeenth-century Dutch painting, was understood as an admonition against a life of sin and vice. A link between the Biblical story and an artist's self-portrait was not, however, completely unusual. Rembrandt, for instance, had depicted himself in a similar pose some twenty years earlier, in his Self-portrait with Saskia in the Scene from the Prodigal Son, which is also in the Dresden collection	METSU, Gabriel	Portrait of the Artist with His Wife Isabella de Wolff in a Tavern	Oil on oak panel, 36 x 31 cm	1661	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700

23116-10carme5.jpg	This painting formed a panel of the predella of the dismembered altarpiece in the Carmelite church San Niccol&#242; al Carmine in Siena. The five scenes in the predella depict events in the history of the Carmelite Order: The Annunciation to Sobac, Hermits at the Fountain of Elijah, St Albert Presents the Rule to the Carmelites, The Pope Issues a Bull to a Carmelite Delegation, and The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV.The long central predella and the next two scenes represent the modern documented history of the Carmelite Order. Some time between 1206 and 1214, Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem, traveled to Mount Carmel an presented the hermits with a Rule. The Rule was accepted by Pope Honorius III in 1226 with a papal bull. A further papal dispensation allowed for the alteration of the Carmelite habit, exchanging the black and white horizontally striped outer cape for a simple white one	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Predella panel: The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV	Tempera on wood	1328-29	religious	Italian	1301-1350

10147-42religi.jpg	Signed at bottom left with a winged serpent, the artist's sign.The works of Lucas Cranach the Elder are as varied and full of incident as was his career as an artist. As a young man, he lived and worked in Vienna from 1500 to 1503, the period when he came in contact with the Danube School, whose development was much influenced by his own work. After 1505 he worked as court painter to Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony in Wittenberg, and in this citadel of the German Reformation he established and directed a large and busy workshop. In addition to altarpieces and religious pictures he painted mythological subjects, genre scenes and portraits, as well as executed a considerable body of graphic work.The black wall on the left side of this painting is the result of a later repainting, presumably a curtain was there originally.

05197-09folly.jpg	"In the midst of a luxuriant summer landscape, a surgeon removes an object from the head of a man tied to a chair; a monk and a nun look on. This little picture may not be entirely by Bosch; the awkward and inexpressive figures are perhaps by an inferior hand, but only Bosch could have been responsible for the landscape background whose delicately painted forms recall the vista in his early Epiphany. The open-air operation, its circular shape suggesting a mirror, is set within a framework of elaborate calligraphical decoration containing the inscription: ""Master, cut the stone out, my name is Lubbert Das.""In Bosch's day, the stone operation was a piece of quackery in which the patient was supposedly cured of his stupidity through the removal of the stone of folly from his forehead. Fortunately, it was performed only in fiction, not in fact, for in literary examples of this theme it generally left the patient worse off than before. The name ""Lubbert"", on the other hand, frequently appears in Dutch literature to designate persons exhibiting an unusually high degree of human stupidity. The stone operation was occasionally represented by later Netherlandish artists, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This subject undoubtedly inspired Bosch's picture, but no extant version of it accounts for the funnel and the book perched on the heads of two of the characters, nor does it explain the presence of the monk and the nun, although their apparent acquiescence in the quackery certainly places them in an unfavourable light. It will be noted, too, that what the surgeon extracts from Lubbert's head is not a stone, but a flower; another flower of the same species lies on the table at the right. The flowers has identified as tulips and their presence is explained as a play on the Dutch word for tulip which in the sixteenth century also carried the connotation of stupidity and folly."

39592-2pesaro0.jpg	Titian was neither such a universal scholar as Leonardo, nor such an outstanding personality as Michelangelo, nor such a versatile and attractive man as Raphael. He was principally a painter, but a painter whose handling of paint equalled Michelangelo's mastery of draughtsmanship. This supreme skill enabled him to disregard all the time-honoured rules of composition, and to rely on colour to restore the unity which he apparently broke up.We need but look at Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family which was begun only some fifteen years after Giovanni Bellini's Madonna with saints to realize the effect which his art must have had on contemporaries. It was almost unheard of to move the Holy Virgin out of the centre of the picture, and to place the two administering saints - St Francis, who is recognizable by the Stigmata (the wounds of the Cross), and St Peter, who has deposited the key (emblem of his dignity) on the steps of the Virgin's throne - not symmetrically on each side, as Giovanni Bellini had done, but as active participants of a scene.In this altar-painting, Titian had to revive the tradition of donors' portraits, but did it in an entirely novel way. The picture was intended as a token of thanksgiving for a victory over the Turks by the Venetian nobleman Jacopo Pesaro, and Titian portrayed him kneeling before the Virgin while an armoured standard-bearer drags a Turkish prisoner behind him. St Peter and the Virgin look down on him benignly while St Francis, on the other side, draws the attention of the Christ Child to the other members of the Pesaro family, who are kneeling in the corner of the picture. The whole scene seems to take place in an open courtyard, with two giant columns which rise into the clouds where two little angels are playfully engaged in raising the Cross.Titian's contemporaries may well have been amazed at the audacity with which he had dared to upset the old-established rules of composition. They must have expected, at first, to find such a picture lopsided and unbalanced. Actually it is the opposite. The unexpected composition only serves to make it gay and lively without upsetting the harmony of it all. The main reason is the way in which Titian contrived to let light, air and colours unify the scene. The idea of making a mere flag counterbalance the figure of the Holy Virgin would probably have shocked an earlier generation, but this flag, in its rich, warm colour, is such a stupendous piece of painting that the venture was a complete success.

14271-2virginc.jpg	The Virgin is seated in the foreground, gently supporting the Child on her lap. Behind Him are placed four figures in front of a flat and undefined background of a striking red, which is decorated with a printed black design of curving tendrils. The artist's technical skill is evident in the transparency of the haloes, which are subtly painted as if they were fine lace. Notable are the modelling of the hands and faces, and the lyrical poses of the Virgin and Child and the background figures	FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI	Virgin and Child with St Catherine and Angels	Mixed technique on panel, 62 x 42 cm	c. 1490	religious	Italian	1451-1500
33958-sebasti1.jpg	During his career Reni and his workshop produced two types of images of St Sebastian, which exist in various versions. The first type, from around 1615, exists in the autograph work now in the Musei di Strada Nuova, Palazzo Rosso in Genoa. Reni returned to the subject around 1616-17, with a different, larger composition. Many versions exist of this work, the painting in the Dulwich Gallery, London, is most likely the original and first one.Powerfully Caravaggesque in its dramatic chiaroscuro, Reni's Sebastian is shown as a striking nude, indebted in its form to antique sculpture and to the classicism of the Bolognese school of the Carracc	RENI, Guido	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas, 170 x 130 cm	1617-18	religious	Italian	1601-1650

36018-orator15.jpg	The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two pictures of the Madonna, the Madonna dell'Umilt&#224; and Madonna with Saints, are also attributed to the Salimbeni brothers for stylistic reasons. These paintings flank a niche, producing the effect of a triptych	SALIMBENI, Lorenzo	Votive pictures	Fresco	c. 1416	religious	Italian	1401-1450
37527-2farnes2.jpg	Chigi's bedchamber was adjacent to the banquet hall, and he had Sodoma decorate two of its wall, probably in conjunction with the decoration of the hall. The surfaces of the walls open up onto a narrative with large-scale figures, as if inviting visitors to enter. In the painting on the wall to the right, the women of Darius's family approach the Macedonian ruler. Sisigambis, the mother of the defeated Persian ruler, initially mistook Hephaistion for Alexander, but the true ruler inclines graciously toward her. The painter revels in his depiction of female grace, pushing the female bodies close together before Alexander and the viewer. The forms on the left also repeat the triad of goddesses, Venus, Ceres, and Juno from Raphael's spandrel in the Loggia di Psiche. The smithy scene along the base of the wall alludes to the love themes and to the fireplace	SODOMA, Il	The Women of Darius's Family before Alexander the Great	Fresco	c. 1517	historical	Italian	1501-1550
39821-17strada.jpg	In the final period, which saw Titian focussing his attention on religious themes, he still found the energy to paint portraits. Between 1567 and 1568 he produced two of his greatest masterpieces in this field: the Prado Self-Portrait and the Portrait of Jacopo Strada in Vienna.The portrait of the well-known antiquarian Jacopo Strada, one of the most famous of Titian's late portraits, represents Jacopo Strada, an expert of antiquities as presenting a small Venus statue. On the table there are some objects, among them a letter addressed to Titian. The decorative frame with the inscription is a later addition from the workshop of Titian.The painting is of the very highest quality. It is painted in energetic dabs of brown and ochre yellow, offset by the black velvet jerkin with a silver fox fur flung around the shoulders. The careful depiction of the details which allude to the profession of the sitter (the statuette, the coins, the cartouche and the books) do not distract from the characterization of Strada, who is looking enquiringly at someone outside the painting	TIZIANO Vecellio	Portrait of Jacopo Strada	Oil on canvas, 125 x 95 cm	1567-68	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
05692-sun1.jpg	The companion piece The Setting of the Sun is also in the Wallace Collection.These extravagant and wonderful pictures show Apollo as God of the Sun leaving Tethys with her Nereids and Tritons in the river Ocean as he drives up the morning sun in his chariot drawn by four white horses, and then returning to her at nightfall. Boucher counted these amongst his most successful pictures	BOUCHER, François	The Rising of the Sun	Oil on canvas, 318 x 261 cm	1753	mythological	French	1701-1750
31453-3saints1.jpg	The decorative skills of Pinturichio are apparent in the vault of this room he painted in the papal apartments of the Vatican. He accentuated the ribs of the vault and in doing so created strong framing elements within which he placed the scenes of the vault. Pinturichio filled all of the available surface with imagery, reserving the direct centre of the ceiling for the Borgia coat of arms. A later pope, Julius II, found serious objection to the decoration, and refused to live in the apartments.The frescoes depict the myth of Isis and Osiris	PINTURICCHIO	Vault decoration	Fresco	1493-95	other	Italian	1451-1500
39585-1assunt1.jpg	"Titian worked on this huge altarpiece for more than two years from 1516 to 1518. It has to be seen as a milestone in Titian's career establishing him as a more universal artist who drew inspiration from outside the confines of Venice. Indeed the powerful figures of the Apostles reflect the influence of Michelangelo, whereas the painting demonstrates clear iconographical similarities with the works of Raphael. Above all, what emerges most strongly in the assumption is Titian's desire to break definitely with the traditions of Venetian painting in order to arrive at a synthesis of dramatic force and dynamic tension which will become from this moment on the most obvious characteristic of his work.The picture is composed of three orders. At the bottom are the Apostles (humanity), amazed and stunned by the wondreous happening. St Peter is kneeling with his hand on his breast, St Thomas is pointing at the Virgin, and St Andrew in a red cloak is stretching forward. In the middle, the madonna, slight and bathed in light, is surrounded by by a host of angels that accompany her joyfully hailing. Above is the Eternal Father, serene and noble majesty, calling the Virgin to him with a look of love.The painting is signed as ""Ticianus"" low down in the middle of the picture"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on wood, 690 x 360 cm	1516-18	religious	Italian	1501-1550

43540-anselmus.jpg	Family harmony is a source of prosperity and happiness. So proclaims the Latin inscription in the cartouche at the top of the picture. This is the message of this family portrait, which does much more than simply depict wealthy members of Antwerp high society. Antonius Anselmus, an alderman of the city from 1580 to 1582, and his wife Joanna Hooftmans, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, are placed in front of a neutral background, accompanied by their two children, both born in Antwerp, Gillis in 1575 and Joanna in 1576. A third child was to be born in Hamburg, where the family sought refuge for a time after the city of Antwerp was returned to the Catholics. The Anselmus family, like the Hooftmans, were Calvinists.The family's high social ranking is immediately visible in the various items of decor: the carved furniture, the silver inkwell on the table, and the fragile Venetian glass vase, as well as the costly lace on the parents' garments and the children's aprons. The little girl holds a sumptuous vermeil rattle, a prestigious object symbolising the wealth of the newly born child. This object was offered to very young children by a godfather or an important person. The one represented here has at one end a whistle and at the other a wolf's tooth, to which popular belief attributed the double power of protecting children against the evil eye and reducing teething pain. On the table between the couple are the marriage gloves and a rose, symbols of the love that unites them. The children express the prosperity of the couple as does the fruit being held by the elder. At the same time the tame bird on his shoulder is a metaphor for a successful education.Maerten de Vos, who excelled in the portrait genre, was also known for his religious paintings, producing, among other works, six paintings of episodes from the life of St Paul for the dining room of Gillis Hooftmans, Joanna's father. It is possibly following this commission that he painted the family portrait. By creating a unified and enveloping space around the figures, the artist succeeded in given a new dimension to the genre, intensifying both the psychological study and the allegorical significance.

24069-3sposi01.jpg	The tent-like vaulting of the Camera degli Sposi contains: in the centre the trompe-l'oeil oculus; in the diamond-shaped compartments eight busts of emperors in medallions; in the side vaults scenes from the myths of Orpheus, Arion, and Hercules.Although painted first, the painting of the ceiling, done in grisaille and imitation gold mosaics, is meant to be the logical continuation of the vertical arrangements of the space. It represents a tent-like roof with pointed vaults above the walls; the painting makes it appear higher than it actually is. Broad groins ornamented with meanders rise up from the painted basket capitals, dividing the ceiling into eight lozenge-shaped fields drawn to sharp points at the bottom, like spandrels. Each lozenge contains a round medallion in which depicted are the first eight Roman emperors. The twelve triangular vaults above the lunettes contain scenes from classical myth and legend, all backed by gold mosaics. First comes three scenes from the Orpheus myth, then three relating to Arion, and finally six depictions of some of the labours of Hercules	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Ceiling decoration	Walnut oil on plaster and fresco	1465-74	religious	Italian	1451-1500

38958-04banque.jpg	Magnificent, brightly lit palace architecture is the setting for Cleopatra's banquet. However, the historical event of the meeting between the Queen of Egypt and the Roman Anthony takes second place to the creation of an opulent banqueting scene in the manner of Veronese. It is therefore the sumptuous costumes, the magnificent receptacles and the rich variety of foods which draw most attention as they are proffered by the servants of the court, who include moors, a dwarf and a dog - a collection of elements typical of the work of Veronese	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Banquet of Cleopatra	Oil on canvas, 249 x 346 cm	1743-44	historical	Italian	1701-1750
14147-06herdsm.jpg	This panel belongs to a body of more than 30 surviving paintings, made over a period of at least a decade, in which Fragonard reproduced the manner of seventeenth-century Dutch landscapes, especially those of Jacob van Ruisdael.

09052-sunshine.jpg	As a result of their approach to Impressionism, Belgian artists occasionally juxtaposed native Flemish styles with imported Impressionist styles derived from the French. One of the major exponents of the more French-oriented line was Emile Claus, who painted in the style of Monet. Paintings such as Sunshine and A Corner of My Garden show how intensely he grappled with the phenomenon of light and different atmospheric conditions.

32349-17ignazi.jpg	The effect of the simulated cupola rests largely on the figural groupings on the pendentives, which were executed immediately after the canvas with the painted cupola was put in place. Painted on actual concave pendentives, they make the sham cupola more believable, especially when viewed from the entrance.
