    "The goal is to resize the photos to 224x224 pixels for ResNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The options are:\n",
    "- Resize to 224x224\n",
    "- Resize with padding to 224x224\n",
    "- Segment into parts and break into 224x224\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the last two options as they will not distort the images. The concern of resizing to 224x224 is the loss of resolution which may reduce the information or eliminate features which would be useful. An example would be Pointillism. This art style is characterized by the use of dots to form its images. If our resolution is too low, our images may no longer show this feature. This is why we will also try to break the image into a 3x3 grid. If necessary the grid can be increased to prevent any information loss, but that would be computationally expensive.\n",
